calculation of the share of energy from renewable sources
1.   the gross final consumption of energy from renewable sources in each member state shall be calculated as the sum of:
(a)
gross final consumption of electricity from renewable energy sources;
(b)
gross final consumption of energy from renewable sources for heating and cooling; and
(c)
final consumption of energy from renewable sources in transport.
gas, electricity and hydrogen from renewable energy sources shall be considered only once in point (a), (b), or (c) of the first subparagraph, for calculating the share of gross final consumption of energy from renewable sources.
subject to the second subparagraph of article 17(1), biofuels and bioliquids that do not fulfil the sustainability criteria set out in article 17(2) to (6) shall not be taken into account.
2.   where a member state considers that, due to force majeure, it is impossible for it to meet its share of energy from renewable sources in gross final consumption of energy in 2020 set out in the third column of the table in annex i, it shall inform the commission accordingly as soon as possible. the commission shall adopt a decision on whether force majeure has been demonstrated. in the event that the commission decides that force majeure has been demonstrated, it shall determine what adjustment shall be made to the member state’s gross final consumption of energy from renewable sources for the year 2020.
3.   for the purposes of paragraph 1(a), gross final consumption of electricity from renewable energy sources shall be calculated as the quantity of electricity produced in a member state from renewable energy sources, excluding the production of electricity in pumped storage units from water that has previously been pumped uphill.
in multi-fuel plants using renewable and conventional sources, only the part of electricity produced from renewable energy sources shall be taken into account. for the purposes of this calculation, the contribution of each energy source shall be calculated on the basis of its energy content.
the electricity generated by hydropower and wind power shall be accounted for in accordance with the normalisation rules set out in annex ii.
4.   for the purposes of paragraph 1(b), the gross final consumption of energy from renewable sources for heating and cooling shall be calculated as the quantity of district heating and cooling produced in a member state from renewable sources, plus the consumption of other energy from renewable sources in industry, households, services, agriculture, forestry and fisheries, for heating, cooling and processing purposes.
in multi-fuel plants using renewable and conventional sources, only the part of heating and cooling produced from renewable energy sources shall be taken into account. for the purposes of this calculation, the contribution of each energy source shall be calculated on the basis of its energy content.
aerothermal, geothermal and hydrothermal heat energy captured by heat pumps shall be taken into account for the purposes of paragraph 1(b) provided that the final energy output significantly exceeds the primary energy input required to drive the heat pumps. the quantity of heat to be considered as energy from renewable sources for the purposes of this directive shall be calculated in accordance with the methodology laid down in annex vii.
thermal energy generated by passive energy systems, under which lower energy consumption is achieved passively through building design or from heat generated by energy from non-renewable sources, shall not be taken into account for the purposes of paragraph 1(b).
5.   the energy content of the transport fuels listed in annex iii shall be taken to be as set out in that annex. annex iii may be adapted to technical and scientific progress. those measures, designed to amend non-essential elements of this directive, shall be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny referred to in article 25(4).
6.   the share of energy from renewable sources shall be calculated as the gross final consumption of energy from renewable sources divided by the gross final consumption of energy from all energy sources, expressed as a percentage.
for the purposes of the first subparagraph, the sum referred to in paragraph 1 shall be adjusted in accordance with articles 6, 8, 10 and 11.
in calculating a member state’s gross final energy consumption for the purpose of measuring its compliance with the targets and indicative trajectory laid down in this directive, the amount of energy consumed in aviation shall, as a proportion of that member state’s gross final consumption of energy, be considered to be no more than 6,18 %. for cyprus and malta the amount of energy consumed in aviation shall, as a proportion of those member states’ gross final consumption of energy, be considered to be no more than 4,12 %.
7.   the methodology and definitions used in the calculation of the share of energy from renewable sources shall be those of regulation (ec) no 1099/2008 of the european parliament and of the council of 22 october 2008 on energy statistics (19).

2.   to that end, member states shall ensure that a guarantee of origin is issued in response to a request from a producer of electricity from renewable energy sources. member states may arrange for guarantees of origin to be issued in response to a request from producers of heating and cooling from renewable energy sources. such an arrangement may be made subject to a minimum capacity limit. a guarantee of origin shall be of the standard size of 1 mwh. no more than one guarantee of origin shall be issued in respect of each unit of energy produced.
member states shall ensure that the same unit of energy from renewable sources is taken into account only once.
member states may provide that no support be granted to a producer when that producer receives a guarantee of origin for the same production of energy from renewable sources.
the guarantee of origin shall have no function in terms of a member state’s compliance with article 3. transfers of guarantees of origin, separately or together with the physical transfer of energy, shall have no effect on the decision of member states to use statistical transfers, joint projects or joint support schemes for target compliance or on the calculation of the gross final consumption of energy from renewable sources in accordance with article 5.
3.   any use of a guarantee of origin shall take place within 12 months of production of the corresponding energy unit. a guarantee of origin shall be cancelled once it has been used.
4.   member states or designated competent bodies shall supervise the issuance, transfer and cancellation of guarantees of origin. the designated competent bodies shall have non-overlapping geographical responsibilities, and be independent of production, trade and supply activities.
5.   member states or the designated competent bodies shall put in place appropriate mechanisms to ensure that guarantees of origin shall be issued, transferred and cancelled electronically and are accurate, reliable and fraud-resistant.
6.   a guarantee of origin shall specify at least:
(a)
the energy source from which the energy was produced and the start and end dates of production;
(b)
whether it relates to:
(i)
electricity; or
(ii)
heating or cooling;
(c)
the identity, location, type and capacity of the installation where the energy was produced;
(d)
whether and to what extent the installation has benefited from investment support, whether and to what extent the unit of energy has benefited in any other way from a national support scheme, and the type of support scheme;
(e)
the date on which the installation became operational; and
(f)
the date and country of issue and a unique identification number.
7.   where an electricity supplier is required to prove the share or quantity of energy from renewable sources in its energy mix for the purposes of article 3(6) of directive 2003/54/ec, it may do so by using its guarantees of origin.
8.   the amount of energy from renewable sources corresponding to guarantees of origin transferred by an electricity supplier to a third party shall be deducted from the share of energy from renewable sources in its energy mix for the purposes of article 3(6) of directive 2003/54/ec.

member states shall ensure that when dispatching electricity generating installations, transmission system operators shall give priority to generating installations using renewable energy sources in so far as the secure operation of the national electricity system permits and based on transparent and non-discriminatory criteria. member states shall ensure that appropriate grid and market-related operational measures are taken in order to minimise the curtailment of electricity produced from renewable energy sources. if significant measures are taken to curtail the renewable energy sources in order to guarantee the security of the national electricity system and security of energy supply, members states shall ensure that the responsible system operators report to the competent regulatory authority on those measures and indicate which corrective measures they intend to take in order to prevent inappropriate curtailments.
3.   member states shall require transmission system operators and distribution system operators to set up and make public their standard rules relating to the bearing and sharing of costs of technical adaptations, such as grid connections and grid reinforcements, improved operation of the grid and rules on the non-discriminatory implementation of the grid codes, which are necessary in order to integrate new producers feeding electricity produced from renewable energy sources into the interconnected grid.
those rules shall be based on objective, transparent and non-discriminatory criteria taking particular account of all the costs and benefits associated with the connection of those producers to the grid and of the particular circumstances of producers located in peripheral regions and in regions of low population density. those rules may provide for different types of connection.
4.   where appropriate, member states may require transmission system operators and distribution system operators to bear, in full or in part, the costs referred to in paragraph 3. member states shall review and take the necessary measures to improve the frameworks and rules for the bearing and sharing of costs referred to in paragraph 3 by 30 june 2011 and every two years thereafter to ensure the integration of new producers as referred to in that paragraph.
5.   member states shall require transmission system operators and distribution system operators to provide any new producer of energy from renewable sources wishing to be connected to the system with the comprehensive and necessary information required, including:
(a)
a comprehensive and detailed estimate of the costs associated with the connection;
(b)
a reasonable and precise timetable for receiving and processing the request for grid connection;
(c)
a reasonable indicative timetable for any proposed grid connection.
member states may allow producers of electricity from renewable energy sources wishing to be connected to the grid to issue a call for tender for the connection work.
6.   the sharing of costs referred in paragraph 3 shall be enforced by a mechanism based on objective, transparent and non-discriminatory criteria taking into account the benefits which initially and subsequently connected producers as well as transmission system operators and distribution system operators derive from the connections.
7.   member states shall ensure that the charging of transmission and distribution tariffs does not discriminate against electricity from renewable energy sources, including in particular electricity from renewable energy sources produced in peripheral regions, such as island regions, and in regions of low population density. member states shall ensure that the charging of transmission and distribution tariffs does not discriminate against gas from renewable energy sources.
8.   member states shall ensure that tariffs charged by transmission system operators and distribution system operators for the transmission and distribution of electricity from plants using renewable energy sources reflect realisable cost benefits resulting from the plant’s connection to the network. such cost benefits could arise from the direct use of the low-voltage grid.
9.   where relevant, member states shall assess the need to extend existing gas network infrastructure to facilitate the integration of gas from renewable energy sources.
10.   where relevant, member states shall require transmission system operators and distribution system operators in their territory to publish technical rules in line with article 6 of directive 2003/55/ec of the european parliament and of the council of 26 june 2003 concerning the common rules for the internal market in natural gas (21), in particular regarding network connection rules that include gas quality, gas odoration and gas pressure requirements. member states shall also require transmission and distribution system operators to publish the connection tariffs to connect renewable gas sources based on transparent and non-discriminatory criteria.
11.   member states in their national renewable energy action plans shall assess the necessity to build new infrastructure for district heating and cooling produced from renewable energy sources in order to achieve the 2020 national target referred to in article 3(1). subject to that assessment, member states shall, where relevant, take steps with a view to developing a district heating infrastructure to accommodate the development of heating and cooling production from large biomass, solar and geothermal facilities."""^^xsd:string ;

sustainability criteria for biofuels and bioliquids
1.   irrespective of whether the raw materials were cultivated inside or outside the territory of the community, energy from biofuels and bioliquids shall be taken into account for the purposes referred to in points (a), (b) and (c) only if they fulfil the sustainability criteria set out in paragraphs 2 to 6:
(a)
measuring compliance with the requirements of this directive concerning national targets;
(b)
measuring compliance with renewable energy obligations;
(c)
eligibility for financial support for the consumption of biofuels and bioliquids.
however, biofuels and bioliquids produced from waste and residues, other than agricultural, aquaculture, fisheries and forestry residues, need only fulfil the sustainability criteria set out in paragraph 2 in order to be taken into account for the purposes referred to in points (a), (b) and (c).
2.   the greenhouse gas emission saving from the use of biofuels and bioliquids taken into account for the purposes referred to in points (a), (b) and (c) of paragraph 1 shall be at least 35 %.
with effect from 1 january 2017, the greenhouse gas emission saving from the use of biofuels and bioliquids taken into account for the purposes referred to in points (a), (b) and (c) of paragraph 1 shall be at least 50 %. from 1 january 2018 that greenhouse gas emission saving shall be at least 60 % for biofuels and bioliquids produced in installations in which production started on or after 1 january 2017.
the greenhouse gas emission saving from the use of biofuels and bioliquids shall be calculated in accordance with article 19(1).
in the case of biofuels and bioliquids produced by installations that were in operation on 23 january 2008, the first subparagraph shall apply from 1 april 2013.
3.   biofuels and bioliquids taken into account for the purposes referred to in points (a), (b) and (c) of paragraph 1 shall not be made from raw material obtained from land with high biodiversity value, namely land that had one of the following statuses in or after january 2008, whether or not the land continues to have that status:
(a)
primary forest and other wooded land, namely forest and other wooded land of native species, where there is no clearly visible indication of human activity and the ecological processes are not significantly disturbed;
(b)
areas designated:
(i)
by law or by the relevant competent authority for nature protection purposes; or
(ii)
for the protection of rare, threatened or endangered ecosystems or species recognised by international agreements or included in lists drawn up by intergovernmental organisations or the international union for the conservation of nature, subject to their recognition in accordance with the second subparagraph of article 18(4);
unless evidence is provided that the production of that raw material did not interfere with those nature protection purposes;
(c)
highly biodiverse grassland that is:
(i)
natural, namely grassland that would remain grassland in the absence of human intervention and which maintains the natural species composition and ecological characteristics and processes; or
(ii)
non-natural, namely grassland that would cease to be grassland in the absence of human intervention and which is species-rich and not degraded, unless evidence is provided that the harvesting of the raw material is necessary to preserve its grassland status.
the commission shall establish the criteria and geographic ranges to determine which grassland shall be covered by point (c) of the first subparagraph. those measures, designed to amend non-essential elements of this directive, by supplementing it shall be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny referred to in article 25(4).
4.   biofuels and bioliquids taken into account for the purposes referred to in points (a), (b) and (c) of paragraph 1 shall not be made from raw material obtained from land with high carbon stock, namely land that had one of the following statuses in january 2008 and no longer has that status:
(a)
wetlands, namely land that is covered with or saturated by water permanently or for a significant part of the year;
(b)
continuously forested areas, namely land spanning more than one hectare with trees higher than five metres and a canopy cover of more than 30 %, or trees able to reach those thresholds in situ;
(c)
land spanning more than one hectare with trees higher than five metres and a canopy cover of between 10 % and 30 %, or trees able to reach those thresholds in situ, unless evidence is provided that the carbon stock of the area before and after conversion is such that, when the methodology laid down in part c of annex v is applied, the conditions laid down in paragraph 2 of this article would be fulfilled.
the provisions of this paragraph shall not apply if, at the time the raw material was obtained, the land had the same status as it had in january 2008.
5.   biofuels and bioliquids taken into account for the purposes referred to in points (a), (b) and (c) of paragraph 1 shall not be made from raw material obtained from land that was peatland in january 2008, unless evidence is provided that the cultivation and harvesting of that raw material does not involve drainage of previously undrained soil.
6.   agricultural raw materials cultivated in the community and used for the production of biofuels and bioliquids taken into account for the purposes referred to in points (a), (b) and (c) of paragraph 1 shall be obtained in accordance with the requirements and standards under the provisions referred to under the heading ‘environment’ in part a and in point 9 of annex ii to council regulation (ec) no 73/2009 of 19 january 2009 establishing common rules for direct support schemes for farmers under the common agricultural policy and establishing certain support schemes for farmers (22) and in accordance with the minimum requirements for good agricultural and environmental condition defined pursuant to article 6(1) of that regulation.
7.   the commission shall, every two years, report to the european parliament and the council, in respect of both third countries and member states that are a significant source of biofuels or of raw material for biofuels consumed within the community, on national measures taken to respect the sustainability criteria set out in paragraphs 2 to 5 and for soil, water and air protection. the first report shall be submitted in 2012.
the commission shall, every two years, report to the european parliament and the council on the impact on social sustainability in the community and in third countries of increased demand for biofuel, on the impact of community biofuel policy on the availability of foodstuffs at affordable prices, in particular for people living in developing countries, and wider development issues. reports shall address the respect of land-use rights. they shall state, both for third countries and member states that are a significant source of raw material for biofuel consumed within the community, whether the country has ratified and implemented each of the following conventions of the international labour organisation:
—
convention concerning forced or compulsory labour (no 29),
—
convention concerning freedom of association and protection of the right to organise (no 87),
—
convention concerning the application of the principles of the right to organise and to bargain collectively (no 98),
—
convention concerning equal remuneration of men and women workers for work of equal value (no 100),
—
convention concerning the abolition of forced labour (no 105),
—
convention concerning discrimination in respect of employment and occupation (no 111),
—
convention concerning minimum age for admission to employment (no 138),
—
convention concerning the prohibition and immediate action for the elimination of the worst forms of child labour (no 182).
those reports shall state, both for third countries and member states that are a significant source of raw material for biofuel consumed within the community, whether the country has ratified and implemented:
—
the cartagena protocol on biosafety,
—
the convention on international trade in endangered species of wild fauna and flora.
the first report shall be submitted in 2012. the commission shall, if appropriate, propose corrective action, in particular if evidence shows that biofuel production has a significant impact on food prices.
8.   for the purposes referred to in points (a), (b) and (c) of paragraph 1, member states shall not refuse to take into account, on other sustainability grounds, biofuels and bioliquids obtained in compliance with this article.
9.   the commission shall report on requirements for a sustainability scheme for energy uses of biomass, other than biofuels and bioliquids, by 31 december 2009. that report shall be accompanied, where appropriate, by proposals for a sustainability scheme for other energy uses of biomass, to the european parliament and the council. that report and any proposals contained therein shall be based on the best available scientific evidence, taking into account new developments in innovative processes. if the analysis done for that purpose demonstrates that it would be appropriate to introduce amendments, in relation to forest biomass, in the calculation methodology in annex v or in the sustainability criteria relating to carbon stocks applied to biofuels and bioliquids, the commission shall, where appropriate, make proposals to the european parliament and council at the same time in this regard."""^^xsd:string ;

verification of compliance with the sustainability criteria for biofuels and bioliquids
1.   where biofuels and bioliquids are to be taken into account for the purposes referred to in points (a), (b) and (c) of article 17(1), member states shall require economic operators to show that the sustainability criteria set out in article 17(2) to (5) have been fulfilled. for that purpose they shall require economic operators to use a mass balance system which:
(a)
allows consignments of raw material or biofuel with differing sustainability characteristics to be mixed;
(b)
requires information about the sustainability characteristics and sizes of the consignments referred to in point (a) to remain assigned to the mixture; and
(c)
provides for the sum of all consignments withdrawn from the mixture to be described as having the same sustainability characteristics, in the same quantities, as the sum of all consignments added to the mixture.
2.   the commission shall report to the european parliament and the council in 2010 and 2012 on the operation of the mass balance verification method described in paragraph 1 and on the potential for allowing for other verification methods in relation to some or all types of raw material, biofuel or bioliquids. in its assessment, the commission shall consider those verification methods in which information about sustainability characteristics need not remain physically assigned to particular consignments or mixtures. the assessment shall take into account the need to maintain the integrity and effectiveness of the verification system while avoiding the imposition of an unreasonable burden on industry. the report shall be accompanied, where appropriate, by proposals to the european parliament and the council concerning the use of other verification methods.
3.   member states shall take measures to ensure that economic operators submit reliable information and make available to the member state, on request, the data that were used to develop the information. member states shall require economic operators to arrange for an adequate standard of independent auditing of the information submitted, and to provide evidence that this has been done. the auditing shall verify that the systems used by economic operators are accurate, reliable and protected against fraud. it shall evaluate the frequency and methodology of sampling and the robustness of the data.
the information referred to in the first subparagraph shall include in particular information on compliance with the sustainability criteria set out in article 17(2) to (5), appropriate and relevant information on measures taken for soil, water and air protection, the restoration of degraded land, the avoidance of excessive water consumption in areas where water is scarce and appropriate and relevant information concerning measures taken in order to take into account the issues referred to in the second subparagraph of article 17(7).
the commission shall, in accordance with the advisory procedure referred to in article 25(3), establish the list of appropriate and relevant information referred to in the first two subparagraphs. it shall ensure, in particular, that the provision of that information does not represent an excessive administrative burden for operators in general or for smallholder farmers, producer organisations and cooperatives in particular.
the obligations laid down in this paragraph shall apply whether the biofuels or bioliquids are produced within the community or imported.
member states shall submit to the commission, in aggregated form, the information referred to in the first subparagraph of this paragraph. the commission shall publish that information on the transparency platform referred to in article 24 in summary form preserving the confidentiality of commercially sensitive information.
4.   the community shall endeavour to conclude bilateral or multilateral agreements with third countries containing provisions on sustainability criteria that correspond to those of this directive. where the community has concluded agreements containing provisions relating to matters covered by the sustainability criteria set out in article 17(2) to (5), the commission may decide that those agreements demonstrate that biofuels and bioliquids produced from raw materials cultivated in those countries comply with the sustainability criteria in question. when those agreements are concluded, due consideration shall be given to measures taken for the conservation of areas that provide, in critical situations, basic ecosystem services (such as watershed protection and erosion control), for soil, water and air protection, indirect land-use changes, the restoration of degraded land, the avoidance of excessive water consumption in areas where water is scarce and to the issues referred to in the second subparagraph of article 17(7).
the commission may decide that voluntary national or international schemes setting standards for the production of biomass products contain accurate data for the purposes of article 17(2) or demonstrate that consignments of biofuel comply with the sustainability criteria set out in article 17(3) to (5). the commission may decide that those schemes contain accurate data for the purposes of information on measures taken for the conservation of areas that provide, in critical situations, basic ecosystem services (such as watershed protection and erosion control), for soil, water and air protection, the restoration of degraded land, the avoidance of excessive water consumption in areas where water is scarce and on the issues referred to in the second subparagraph of article 17(7). the commission may also recognise areas for the protection of rare, threatened or endangered ecosystems or species recognised by international agreements or included in lists drawn up by intergovernmental organisations or the international union for the conservation of nature for the purposes of article 17(3)(b)(ii).
the commission may decide that voluntary national or international schemes to measure greenhouse gas emission saving contain accurate data for the purposes of article 17(2).
the commission may decide that land that falls within the scope of a national or regional recovery programme aimed at improving severely degraded or heavily contaminated land fulfils the criteria referred to in point 9 of part c of annex v.
5.   the commission shall adopt decisions under paragraph 4 only if the agreement or scheme in question meets adequate standards of reliability, transparency and independent auditing. in the case of schemes to measure greenhouse gas emission saving, such schemes shall also comply with the methodological requirements in annex v. lists of areas of high biodiversity value as referred to in article 17(3)(b)(ii) shall meet adequate standards of objectivity and coherence with internationally recognised standards and provide for appropriate appeal procedures.
6.   decisions under paragraph 4 shall be adopted in accordance with the advisory procedure referred to in article 25(3). such decisions shall be valid for a period of no more than five years.
7.   when an economic operator provides proof or data obtained in accordance with an agreement or scheme that has been the subject of a decision pursuant to paragraph 4, to the extent covered by that decision, a member state shall not require the supplier to provide further evidence of compliance with the sustainability criteria set out in article 17(2) to (5) nor information on measures referred to in the second subparagraph of paragraph 3 of this article.
8.   at the request of a member state or on its own initiative the commission shall examine the application of article 17 in relation to a source of biofuel or bioliquid and, within six months of receipt of a request and in accordance with the advisory procedure referred to in article 25(3), decide whether the member state concerned may take biofuel or bioliquid from that source into account for the purposes referred to in points (a), (b) and (c) of article 17(1).
9.   by 31 december 2012, the commission shall report to the european parliament and to the council on:
(a)
the effectiveness of the system in place for the provision of information on sustainability criteria; and
(b)
whether it is feasible and appropriate to introduce mandatory requirements in relation to air, soil or water protection, taking into account the latest scientific evidence and the community’s international obligations.
the commission shall, if appropriate, propose corrective action."""^^xsd:string ;

2.   by 31 march 2010, member states shall submit to the commission a report including a list of those areas on their territory classified as level 2 in the nomenclature of territorial units for statistics (nuts) or as a more disaggregated nuts level in accordance with regulation (ec) no 1059/2003 of the european parliament and of the council of 26 may 2003 on the establishment of a common classification of territorial units for statistics (nuts) (23) where the typical greenhouse gas emissions from cultivation of agricultural raw materials can be expected to be lower than or equal to the emissions reported under the heading ‘disaggregated default values for cultivation’ in part d of annex v to this directive, accompanied by a description of the method and data used to establish that list. that method shall take into account soil characteristics, climate and expected raw material yields.
3.   the default values in part a of annex v for biofuels, and the disaggregated default values for cultivation in part d of annex v for biofuels and bioliquids, may be used only when their raw materials are:
(a)
cultivated outside the community;
(b)
cultivated in the community in areas included in the lists referred to in paragraph 2; or
(c)
waste or residues other than agricultural, aquaculture and fisheries residues.
for biofuels and bioliquids not falling under points (a), (b) or (c), actual values for cultivation shall be used.
4.   by 31 march 2010, the commission shall submit a report to the european parliament and to the council on the feasibility of drawing up lists of areas in third countries where the typical greenhouse gas emissions from cultivation of agricultural raw materials can be expected to be lower than or equal to the emissions reported under the heading ‘cultivation’ in part d of annex v, accompanied if possible by such lists and a description of the method and data used to establish them. the report shall, if appropriate, be accompanied by relevant proposals.
5.   the commission shall report by 31 december 2012, and every two years thereafter, on the estimated typical and default values in parts b and e of annex v, paying particular attention to emissions from transport and processing, and may, where necessary, decide to correct the values. those measures, designed to amend non-essential elements of this directive, shall be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny referred to in article 25(4).
6.   the commission shall, by 31 december 2010, submit a report to the european parliament and to the council reviewing the impact of indirect land-use change on greenhouse gas emissions and addressing ways to minimise that impact. the report shall, if appropriate, be accompanied, by a proposal, based on the best available scientific evidence, containing a concrete methodology for emissions from carbon stock changes caused by indirect land-use changes, ensuring compliance with this directive, in particular article 17(2).
such a proposal shall include the necessary safeguards to provide certainty for investment undertaken before that methodology is applied. with respect to installations that produced biofuels before the end of 2013, the application of the measures referred to in the first subparagraph shall not, until 31 december 2017, lead to biofuels produced by those installations being deemed to have failed to comply with the sustainability requirements of this directive if they would otherwise have done so, provided that those biofuels achieve a greenhouse gas emission saving of at least 45 %. this shall apply to the capacities of the installations of biofuels at the end of 2012.
the european parliament and the council shall endeavour to decide, by 31 december 2012, on any such proposals submitted by the commission.
7.   annex v may be adapted to technical and scientific progress, including by the addition of values for further biofuel production pathways for the same or for other raw materials and by modifying the methodology laid down in part c. those measures, designed to amend non-essential elements of this directive, inter alia, by supplementing it, shall be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny referred to in article 25(4).
regarding the default values and methodology laid down in annex v, particular consideration shall be given to:
—
the method of accounting for wastes and residues,
—
the method of accounting for co-products,
—
the method of accounting for cogeneration, and
—
the status given to agricultural crop residues as co-products.
the default values for waste vegetable or animal oil biodiesel shall be reviewed as soon as possible.
any adaptation of or addition to the list of default values in annex v shall comply with the following:
(a)
where the contribution of a factor to overall emissions is small, or where there is limited variation, or where the cost or difficulty of establishing actual values is high, default values must be typical of normal production processes;
(b)
in all other cases default values must be conservative compared to normal production processes.
8.   detailed definitions, including technical specifications required for the categories set out in point 9 of part c of annex v shall be established. those measures, designed to amend non-essential elements of this directive by supplementing it, shall be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny referred to in article 25(4)."""^^xsd:string ;

monitoring and reporting by the commission
1.   the commission shall monitor the origin of biofuels and bioliquids consumed in the community and the impact of their production, including impact as a result of displacement, on land use in the community and the main third countries of supply. such monitoring shall be based on member states’ reports, submitted pursuant to article 22(1), and those of relevant third countries, intergovernmental organisations, scientific studies and any other relevant pieces of information. the commission shall also monitor the commodity price changes associated with the use of biomass for energy and any associated positive and negative effects on food security. the commission shall monitor all installations to which article 19(6) applies.
2.   the commission shall maintain a dialogue and exchange information with third countries and biofuel producers, consumer organisations and civil society concerning the general implementation of the measures in this directive relating to biofuels and bioliquids. it shall, within that framework, pay particular attention to the impact biofuel production may have on food prices.
3.   on the basis of the reports submitted by member states pursuant to article 22(1) and the monitoring and analysis referred to in paragraph 1 of this article, the commission shall report every two years to the european parliament and the council. the first report shall be submitted in 2012.
4.   in reporting on greenhouse gas emission saving from the use of biofuels, the commission shall use the values reported by member states and shall evaluate whether and how the estimate would change if co-products were accounted for using the substitution approach.
5.   in its reports, the commission shall, in particular, analyse:
(a)
the relative environmental benefits and costs of different biofuels, the effects of the community’s import policies thereon, the security of supply implications and the ways of achieving a balanced approach between domestic production and imports;
(b)
the impact of increased demand for biofuel on sustainability in the community and in third countries, considering economic and environmental impacts, including impacts on biodiversity;
(c)
the scope for identifying, in a scientifically objective manner, geographical areas of high biodiversity value that are not covered in article 17(3);
(d)
the impact of increased demand for biomass on biomass using sectors;
(e)

(b)
with respect to the target referred to in article 3(4), a review of:
(i)
the cost-efficiency of the measures to be implemented to achieve the target;
(ii)
an assessment of the feasibility of reaching the target whilst ensuring the sustainability of biofuels production in the community and in third countries, and considering economic, environmental and social impacts, including indirect effects and impacts on biodiversity, as well as the commercial availability of second-generation biofuels;
(iii)
the impact of the implementation of the target on the availability of foodstuffs at affordable prices;
(iv)
the commercial availability of electric, hybrid and hydrogen powered vehicles, as well as the methodology chosen to calculate the share of energy from renewable sources consumed in the transport sector;
(v)
the evaluation of specific market conditions, considering, in particular, markets on which transport fuels represent more than half of the final energy consumption, and markets which are fully dependent on imported biofuels;
(c)
an evaluation of the implementation of this directive, in particular with regard to cooperation mechanisms, in order to ensure that, together with the possibility for the members states to continue to use national support schemes referred to in article 3(3), those mechanisms enable member states to achieve the national targets defined in annex i on the best cost-benefit basis, of technological developments, and the conclusions to be drawn to achieve the target of 20 % of energy from renewable sources at community level.
on the basis of that report, the commission shall submit, if appropriate, proposals to the european parliament and the council, addressing the above elements and in particular:
—
for the element contained in point (a), a modification of the minimum greenhouse gas emission saving referred to in that point, and
—
for the element contained in point (c), appropriate adjustments of the cooperation measures provided for in this directive in order to improve their effectiveness for achieving the target of 20 %. such proposals shall neither affect the 20 % target nor member states’ control over national support schemes and cooperation measures.

exemplary role of public bodies’ buildings
1.   without prejudice to article 7 of directive 2010/31/eu, each member state shall ensure that, as from 1 january 2014, 3 % of the total floor area of heated and/or cooled buildings owned and occupied by its central government is renovated each year to meet at least the minimum energy performance requirements that it has set in application of article 4 of directive 2010/31/eu.
the 3 % rate shall be calculated on the total floor area of buildings with a total useful floor area over 500 m2 owned and occupied by the central government of the member state concerned that, on 1 january of each year, do not meet the national minimum energy performance requirements set in application of article 4 of directive 2010/31/eu. that threshold shall be lowered to 250 m2 as of 9 july 2015.
where a member state requires that the obligation to renovate each year 3 % of the total floor area extends to floor area owned and occupied by administrative departments at a level below central government, the 3 % rate shall be calculated on the total floor area of buildings with a total useful floor area over 500 m2 and, as of 9 july 2015, over 250 m2 owned and occupied by central government and by these administrative departments of the member state concerned that, on 1 january of each year, do not meet the national minimum energy performance requirements set in application of article 4 of directive 2010/31/eu.
when implementing measures for the comprehensive renovation of central government buildings in accordance with the first subparagraph, member states may choose to consider the building as a whole, including the building envelope, equipment, operation and maintenance.
member states shall require that central government buildings with the poorest energy performance be a priority for energy efficiency measures, where cost-effective and technically feasible.
2.   member states may decide not to set or apply the requirements referred to in paragraph 1 to the following categories of buildings:
(a)
buildings officially protected as part of a designated environment, or because of their special architectural or historical merit, in so far as compliance with certain minimum energy performance requirements would unacceptably alter their character or appearance;
(b)
buildings owned by the armed forces or central government and serving national defence purposes, apart from single living quarters or office buildings for the armed forces and other staff employed by national defence authorities;
(c)
buildings used as places of worship and for religious activities.
3.   if a member state renovates more than 3 % of the total floor area of central government buildings in a given year, it may count the excess towards the annual renovation rate of any of the three previous or following years.
4.   member states may count towards the annual renovation rate of central government buildings new buildings occupied and owned as replacements for specific central government buildings demolished in any of the two previous years, or buildings that have been sold, demolished or taken out of use in any of the two previous years due to more intensive use of other buildings.
5.   for the purposes of paragraph 1, by 31 december 2013, member states shall establish and make publicly available an inventory of heated and/or cooled central government buildings with a total useful floor area over 500 m2 and, as of 9 july 2015, over 250 m2, excluding buildings exempted on the basis of paragraph 2. the inventory shall contain the following data:
(a)
the floor area in m2; and
(b)
the energy performance of each building or relevant energy data.
6.   without prejudice to article 7 of directive 2010/31/eu, member states may opt for an alternative approach to paragraphs 1 to 5 of this article, whereby they take other cost-effective measures, including deep renovations and measures for behavioural change of occupants, to achieve, by 2020, an amount of energy savings in eligible buildings owned and occupied by their central government that is at least equivalent to that required in paragraph 1, reported on an annual basis.
for the purpose of the alternative approach, member states may estimate the energy savings that paragraphs 1 to 4 would generate by using appropriate standard values for the energy consumption of reference central government buildings before and after renovation and according to estimates of the surface of their stock. the categories of reference central government buildings shall be representative of the stock of such buildings.
member states opting for the alternative approach shall notify to the commission, by 31 december 2013, the alternative measures that they plan to adopt, showing how they would achieve an equivalent improvement in the energy performance of the buildings within the central government estate.
7.   member states shall encourage public bodies, including at regional and local level, and social housing bodies governed by public law, with due regard for their respective competences and administrative set-up, to:
(a)
adopt an energy efficiency plan, freestanding or as part of a broader climate or environmental plan, containing specific energy saving and efficiency objectives and actions, with a view to following the exemplary role of central government buildings laid down in paragraphs 1, 5 and 6;
(b)
put in place an energy management system, including energy audits, as part of the implementation of their plan;
(c)
use, where appropriate, energy service companies, and energy performance contracting to finance renovations and implement plans to maintain or improve energy efficiency in the long term."""^^xsd:string ;

(a)
include requirements with a social aim in the saving obligations they impose, including by requiring a share of energy efficiency measures to be implemented as a priority in households affected by energy poverty or in social housing;
(b)
permit obligated parties to count towards their obligation certified energy savings achieved by energy service providers or other third parties, including when obligated parties promote measures through other state-approved bodies or through public authorities that may or may not involve formal partnerships and may be in combination with other sources of finance. where member states so permit, they shall ensure that an approval process is in place which is clear, transparent and open to all market actors, and which aims at minimising the costs of certification;
(c)
allow obligated parties to count savings obtained in a given year as if they had instead been obtained in any of the four previous or three following years.
8.   once a year, member states shall publish the energy savings achieved by each obligated party, or each sub-category of obligated party, and in total under the scheme.
member states shall ensure that obligated parties provide on request:
(a)
aggregated statistical information on their final customers (identifying significant changes to previously submitted information); and
(b)
current information on final customers’ consumption, including, where applicable, load profiles, customer segmentation and geographical location of customers, while preserving the integrity and confidentiality of private or commercially sensitive information in compliance with applicable union law.
such a request shall be made not more than once a year.
9.   as an alternative to setting up an energy efficiency obligation scheme under paragraph 1, member states may opt to take other policy measures to achieve energy savings among final customers, provided those policy measures meet the criteria set out in paragraphs 10 and 11. the annual amount of new energy savings achieved through this approach shall be equivalent to the amount of new energy savings required by paragraphs 1, 2 and 3. provided that equivalence is maintained, member states may combine obligation schemes with alternative policy measures, including national energy efficiency programmes.
the policy measures referred to in the first subparagraph may include, but are not restricted to, the following policy measures or combinations thereof:
(a)
energy or co2 taxes that have the effect of reducing end-use energy consumption;

energy transformation, transmission and distribution
1.   member states shall ensure that national energy regulatory authorities pay due regard to energy efficiency in carrying out the regulatory tasks specified in directives 2009/72/ec and 2009/73/ec regarding their decisions on the operation of the gas and electricity infrastructure.
member states shall in particular ensure that national energy regulatory authorities, through the development of network tariffs and regulations, within the framework of directive 2009/72/ec and taking into account the costs and benefits of each measure, provide incentives for grid operators to make available system services to network users permitting them to implement energy efficiency improvement measures in the context of the continuing deployment of smart grids.
such systems services may be determined by the system operator and shall not adversely impact the security of the system.
for electricity, member states shall ensure that network regulation and network tariffs fulfil the criteria in annex xi, taking into account guidelines and codes developed pursuant to regulation (ec) no 714/2009.
2.   member states shall ensure, by 30 june 2015, that:
(a)
an assessment is undertaken of the energy efficiency potentials of their gas and electricity infrastructure, in particular regarding transmission, distribution, load management and interoperability, and connection to energy generating installations, including access possibilities for micro energy generators;
(b)
concrete measures and investments are identified for the introduction of cost-effective energy efficiency improvements in the network infrastructure, with a timetable for their introduction.
3.   member states may permit components of schemes and tariff structures with a social aim for net-bound energy transmission and distribution, provided that any disruptive effects on the transmission and distribution system are kept to the minimum necessary and are not disproportionate to the social aim.
4.   member states shall ensure the removal of those incentives in transmission and distribution tariffs that are detrimental to the overall efficiency (including energy efficiency) of the generation, transmission, distribution and supply of electricity or those that might hamper participation of demand response, in balancing markets and ancillary services procurement. member states shall ensure that network operators are incentivised to improve efficiency in infrastructure design and operation, and, within the framework of directive 2009/72/ec, that tariffs allow suppliers to improve consumer participation in system efficiency, including demand response, depending on national circumstances.
5.   without prejudice to article 16(2) of directive 2009/28/ec and taking into account article 15 of directive 2009/72/ec and the need to ensure continuity in heat supply, member states shall ensure that, subject to requirements relating to the maintenance of the reliability and safety of the grid, based on transparent and non-discriminatory criteria set by the competent national authorities, transmission system operators and distribution system operators when they are in charge of dispatching the generating installations in their territory:
(a)
guarantee the transmission and distribution of electricity from high-efficiency cogeneration;
(b)
provide priority or guaranteed access to the grid of electricity from high-efficiency cogeneration;
(c)
when dispatching electricity generating installations, provide priority dispatch of electricity from high-efficiency cogeneration in so far as the secure operation of the national electricity system permits.
member states shall ensure that rules relating to the ranking of the different access and dispatch priorities granted in their electricity systems are clearly explained in detail and published. when providing priority access or dispatch for high-efficiency cogeneration, member states may set rankings as between, and within different types of, renewable energy and high-efficiency cogeneration and shall in any case ensure that priority access or dispatch for energy from variable renewable energy sources is not hampered.
in addition to the obligations laid down by the first subparagraph, transmission system operators and distribution system operators shall comply with the requirements set out in annex xii.
member states may particularly facilitate the connection to the grid system of electricity produced from high-efficiency cogeneration from small-scale and micro-cogeneration units. member states shall, where appropriate, take steps to encourage network operators to adopt a simple notification ‘install and inform’ process for the installation of micro-cogeneration units to simplify and shorten authorisation procedures for individual citizens and installers.
6.   subject to the requirements relating to the maintenance of the reliability and safety of the grid, member states shall take the appropriate steps to ensure that, where this is technically and economically feasible with the mode of operation of the high-efficiency cogeneration installation, high-efficiency cogeneration operators can offer balancing services and other operational services at the level of transmission system operators or distribution system operators. transmission system operators and distribution system operators shall ensure that such services are part of a services bidding process which is transparent, non-discriminatory and open to scrutiny.
where appropriate, member states may require transmission system operators and distribution system operators to encourage high-efficiency cogeneration to be sited close to areas of demand by reducing the connection and use-of-system charges.
7.   member states may allow producers of electricity from high-efficiency cogeneration wishing to be connected to the grid to issue a call for tender for the connection work.
8.   member states shall ensure that national energy regulatory authorities encourage demand side resources, such as demand response, to participate alongside supply in wholesale and retail markets.
subject to technical constraints inherent in managing networks, member states shall ensure that transmission system operators and distribution system operators, in meeting requirements for balancing and ancillary services, treat demand response providers, including aggregators, in a non-discriminatory manner, on the basis of their technical capabilities.
subject to technical constraints inherent in managing networks, member states shall promote access to and participation of demand response in balancing, reserve and other system services markets, inter alia by requiring national energy regulatory authorities or, where their national regulatory systems so require, transmission system operators and distribution system operators in close cooperation with demand service providers and consumers, to define technical modalities for participation in these markets on the basis of the technical requirements of these markets and the capabilities of demand response. such specifications shall include the participation of aggregators.
9.   when reporting under directive 2010/75/eu, and without prejudice to article 9(2) of that directive, member states shall consider including information on energy efficiency levels of installations undertaking the combustion of fuels with total rated thermal input of 50 mw or more in the light of the relevant best available techniques developed in accordance with directive 2010/75/eu and directive 2008/1/ec of the european parliament and of the council of 15 january 2008 concerning integrated pollution prevention and control (27).

5.   the commission shall review the continued need for the possibility of exemptions set out in article 14(6) for the first time in the assessment of the first national energy efficiency action plan and every three years thereafter. where the review shows that any of the criteria for these exemptions can no longer be justified taking into account the availability of heat load and the real operating conditions of the exempted installations, the commission shall propose appropriate measures.
6.   member states shall submit to the commission before 30 april each year statistics on national electricity and heat production from high and low efficiency cogeneration, in accordance with the methodology shown in annex i, in relation to total heat and electricity production. they shall also submit annual statistics on cogeneration heat and electricity capacities and fuels for cogeneration, and on district heating and cooling production and capacities, in relation to total heat and electricity production and capacities. member states shall submit statistics on primary energy savings achieved by application of cogeneration in accordance with the methodology shown in annex ii.
7.   by 30 june 2014 the commission shall submit the assessment referred to in article 3(2) to the european parliament and to the council, accompanied, if necessary, by proposals for further measures.
8.   the commission shall review the effectiveness of the implementation of article 6 by 5 december 2015, taking into account the requirements laid down in directive 2004/18/ec and shall submit a report to the european parliament and the council. that report shall be accompanied, if appropriate, by proposals for further measures.
9.   by 30 june 2016, the commission shall submit a report to the european parliament and the council on the implementation of article 7. that report shall be accompanied, if appropriate, by a legislative proposal for one or more of the following purposes:
(a)
to change the final date laid down in article 7(1);
(b)
to review the requirements laid down in article 7(1), (2) and (3);
(c)
to establish additional common requirements, in particular as regards the matters referred to in article 7(7).
10.   by 30 june 2018, the commission shall assess the progress made by member states in removing the regulatory and non-regulatory barriers referred to in article 19(1). this assessment shall be followed, if appropriate, by proposals for further measures.
11.   the commission shall make the reports referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 publicly available."""^^xsd:string ;

1.   without prejudice to directive 2009/30/ec, member states shall ensure that relevant, consistent and clear information is made available as regards those motor vehicles which can be regularly fuelled with individual fuels placed on the market, or recharged by recharging points. such information shall be made available in motor vehicle manuals, at refuelling and recharging points, on motor vehicles and in motor vehicle dealerships in their territory. this requirement shall apply to all motor vehicles, and their motor vehicle manuals, placed on the market after 18 november 2016.
2.   the supply of information referred to in paragraph 1 shall be based on the labelling provisions regarding fuel compliance under standards of the esos setting the technical specifications of fuels. where such standards refer to a graphical expression, including a colour coding scheme, the graphical expression shall be simple and easy to understand, and it shall be placed in a clearly visible manner:
(a)
on corresponding pumps and their nozzles at all refuelling points, as from the date on which fuels are placed on the market;
(b)
on or in the immediate proximity of all fuel tanks' filling caps of motor vehicles recommended and compatible with that fuel and in motor vehicle manuals, when such motor vehicles are placed on the market after 18 november 2016.
3.   where appropriate, and in particular for natural gas and hydrogen, when fuel prices are displayed at a fuel station, a comparison between the relevant unit prices shall be displayed for information purposes. the display of this information shall not mislead or confuse the user.
in order to increase consumer awareness and provide for fuel price transparency in a consistent way across the union, the commission shall be empowered to adopt, by means of implementing acts, a common methodology for alternative fuels unit price comparison.
4.   where eso standards setting technical specifications of a fuel do not include labelling provisions for compliance with the standards in question, where the labelling provisions do not refer to a graphical expression including colour coding schemes, or where the labelling provisions are not suitable for attaining the objectives of this directive, the commission may, for the purposes of the uniform implementation of paragraphs 1 and 2, mandate esos to develop compatibility labelling specifications, or may adopt implementing acts determining the graphical expression, including a colour coding scheme, of compatibility for fuels introduced in the union market which reach the level of 1 % of the total volume of sales, in the assessment of the commission, in more than one member state.
5.   if labelling provisions of the respective eso standards are updated, if implementing acts regarding the labelling are adopted or if new eso standards for alternative fuels are developed as necessary, the corresponding labelling requirements shall apply to all refuelling and recharging points and motor vehicles registered on the territory of the member states as of 24 months after their respective updating or adoption.
6.   the implementing acts referred to in this article shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in article 9(2).
7.   member states shall ensure that, when available, the data indicating the geographic location of the refuelling and recharging points accessible to the public of alternative fuels covered by this directive are accessible on an open and non-discriminatory basis to all users. for recharging points, such data, when available, may include information on real-time accessibility as well as historical and real-time charging information."""^^xsd:string ;

(a)
all emissions from flights to and from aerodromes located in countries outside the european economic area (eea) in each calendar year from 1 january 2013 to 31 december 2016;
(b)
all emissions from flights between an aerodrome located in an outermost region within the meaning of article 349 of the treaty on the functioning of the european union (tfeu) and an aerodrome located in another region of the eea in each calendar year from 1 january 2013 to 31 december 2016;
(c)

for the purposes of articles 11a, 12 and 14, the verified emissions from flights other than those referred to in the first subparagraph shall be considered to be the verified emissions of the aircraft operator.
2.   by way of derogation from article 3e(5) and article 3f, an aircraft operator benefitting from the derogations provided for in points (a) and (b) of paragraph 1 of this article shall be issued a number of free allowances reduced in proportion to the reduction of the surrender obligation provided for in those points.
by way of derogation from article 3f(8), allowances that are not allocated, as a result of the application of the first subparagraph of this paragraph, shall be cancelled.
as regards activity in the period from 1 january 2013 to 31 december 2016, member states shall publish the number of free aviation allowances allocated to each aircraft operator by 1 august 2014.
3.   by way of derogation from article 3d, member states shall auction a number of aviation allowances reduced in proportion to the reduction in the total number of allowances issued.
4.   by way of derogation from article 3d(3), the number of allowances to be auctioned by each member state in respect of the period from 1 january 2013 to 31 december 2016 shall be reduced to correspond to its share of attributed aviation emissions from flights which are not subject to the derogations provided for in points (a) and (b) of paragraph 1 of this article.
5.   by way of derogation from article 3g, aircraft operators shall not be required to submit monitoring plans setting out measures to monitor and report emissions in respect of flights which are subject to the derogations provided for in points (a) and (b) of paragraph 1 of this article.
6.   by way of derogation from articles 3g, 12, 15 and 18a, where an aircraft operator has total annual emissions lower than 25 000 tonnes co2, its emissions shall be considered to be verified emissions if determined by using the small emitters tool approved under commission regulation (eu) no 606/2010 (5) and populated by eurocontrol with data from its ets support facility. member states may implement simplified procedures for non-commercial aircraft operators as long as such procedures provide no less accuracy than the small emitters tool provides.
7.   for the purposes of this article, flights between aerodromes located in states of the eea and countries that acceded to the union in 2013 shall be considered to be flights between aerodromes located in states of the eea.
8.   the commission shall regularly, and at least once a year, inform the european parliament and the council of the progress of the international civil aviation organization (icao) negotiations as well as of its efforts to promote the international acceptance of market-based mechanisms among third countries. following the 2016 icao assembly, the commission shall report to the european parliament and to the council on actions to implement an international agreement on a global market-based measure from 2020, that will reduce greenhouse gas emissions from aviation in a non-discriminatory manner, including on information, with regard to the use of revenues, submitted by member states in accordance with article 17 of regulation (eu) no 525/2013.
in its report, the commission shall consider, and, if appropriate, include proposals in reaction to, those developments on the appropriate scope for coverage of emissions from activity to and from aerodromes located in countries outside the eea from 1 january 2017 onwards. in its report, the commission shall also consider solutions to other issues that may arise in the application of paragraphs 1 to 4 of this article, while preserving the equal treatment of all aircraft operators on the same route.

binding overall union target for 2030
1.   member states shall collectively ensure that the share of energy from renewable sources in the union's gross final consumption of energy in 2030 is at least 32 %. the commission shall assess that target with a view to submitting a legislative proposal by 2023 to increase it where there are further substantial costs reductions in the production of renewable energy, where needed to meet the union's international commitments for decarbonisation, or where a significant decrease in energy consumption in the union justifies such an increase.
2.   member states shall set national contributions to meet, collectively, the binding overall union target set in paragraph 1 of this article as part of their integrated national energy and climate plans in accordance with articles 3 to 5 and 9 to 14 of regulation (eu) 2018/1999. in preparing their draft integrated national energy and climate plans, member states may consider the formula referred to in annex ii to that regulation.
if, on the basis of the assessment of the draft integrated national energy and climate plans submitted pursuant to article 9 of regulation (eu) 2018/1999, the commission concludes that the national contributions of the member states are insufficient for the collective achievement of the binding overall union target, it shall follow the procedure laid down in articles 9 and 31 of that regulation.
3.   member states shall ensure that their national policies, including the obligations deriving from articles 25 to 28 of this directive, and their support schemes, are designed with due regard to the waste hierarchy as set out in article 4 of directive 2008/98/ec to aim to avoid undue distortive effects on the raw material markets. member states shall grant no support for renewable energy produced from the incineration of waste if the separate collection obligations laid down in that directive have not been complied with.
4.   from 1 january 2021, the share of energy from renewable sources in each member state's gross final consumption of energy shall not be lower than the baseline share shown in the third column of the table in part a of annex i to this directive. member states shall take the necessary measures to ensure compliance with that baseline share. if a member state does not maintain its baseline share as measured over any one-year period, the first and second subparagraphs of article 32(4) of regulation (eu) 2018/1999 shall apply.
5.   the commission shall support the high ambition of member states through an enabling framework comprising the enhanced use of union funds, including additional funds to facilitate a just transition of carbon intensive regions towards increased shares of renewable energy, in particular financial instruments, especially for the following purposes:
(a)
reducing the cost of capital for renewable energy projects;
(b)
developing projects and programmes for integrating renewable sources into the energy system, for increasing flexibility of the energy system, for maintaining grid stability and for managing grid congestions;
(c)
developing transmission and distribution grid infrastructure, intelligent networks, storage facilities and interconnections, with the objective of arriving at a 15 % electricity interconnection target by 2030, in order to increase the technically feasible and economically affordable level of renewable energy in the electricity system;
(d)
enhancing regional cooperation between member states and between member states and third countries, through joint projects, joint support schemes and the opening of support schemes for renewable electricity to producers located in other member states.
6.   the commission shall establish a facilitative platform in order to support member states that use cooperation mechanisms to contribute to the binding overall union target set in paragraph 1."""^^xsd:string ;

support schemes for energy from renewable sources
1.   in order to reach or exceed the union target set in article 3(1), and each member state's contribution to that target set at a national level for the deployment of renewable energy, member states may apply support schemes.
2.   support schemes for electricity from renewable sources shall provide incentives for the integration of electricity from renewable sources in the electricity market in a market-based and market-responsive way, while avoiding unnecessary distortions of electricity markets as well as taking into account possible system integration costs and grid stability.
3.   support schemes for electricity from renewable sources shall be designed so as to maximise the integration of electricity from renewable sources in the electricity market and to ensure that renewable energy producers are responding to market price signals and maximise their market revenues.
to that end, with regard to direct price support schemes, support shall be granted in the form of a market premium, which could be, inter alia, sliding or fixed.
member states may exempt small-scale installations and demonstration projects from this paragraph, without prejudice to the applicable union law on the internal market for electricity.
4.   member states shall ensure that support for electricity from renewable sources is granted in an open, transparent, competitive, non-discriminatory and cost-effective manner.
member states may exempt small-scale installations and demonstration projects from tendering procedures.
member states may also consider establishing mechanisms to ensure the regional diversification in the deployment of renewable electricity, in particular to ensure cost-efficient system integration.
5.   member states may limit tendering procedures to specific technologies where opening support schemes to all producers of electricity from renewable sources would lead to a suboptimal result, in view of:
(a)
the long-term potential of a particular technology;
(b)
the need to achieve diversification;
(c)
grid integration costs;
(d)
network constraints and grid stability;
(e)
for biomass, the need to avoid distortions of raw materials markets.
6.   where support for electricity from renewable sources is granted by means of a tendering procedure, member states shall, in order to ensure a high project realisation rate:
(a)
establish and publish non-discriminatory and transparent criteria to qualify for the tendering procedure and set clear dates and rules for delivery of the project;
(b)
publish information about previous tendering procedures, including project realisation rates.
7.   in order to increase the generation of energy from renewable sources in the outermost regions and small islands, member states may adapt financial support schemes for projects located in those regions in order to take into account the production costs associated with their specific conditions of isolation and external dependence.
8.   by 31 december 2021 and every three years thereafter, the commission shall report to the european parliament and to the council on the performance of support for electricity from renewable sources granted by means of tendering procedures in the union, analysing in particular the ability of tendering procedures to:
(a)
achieve cost-reduction;
(b)
achieve technological improvement;
(c)
achieve high realisation rates;
(d)
provide non-discriminatory participation of small actors and, where applicable, local authorities;
(e)
limit environmental impact;
(f)
ensure local acceptability;
(g)
ensure security of supply and grid integration.

opening of support schemes for electricity from renewable sources
1.   member states shall have the right, in accordance with articles 7 to 13 of this directive, to decide to which extent they support electricity from renewable sources which is produced in another member state. however, member states may open participation in support schemes for electricity from renewable sources to producers located in other member states, subject to the conditions laid down in this article.
when opening participation in support schemes for electricity from renewable sources, member states may provide that support for an indicative share of the newly-supported capacity, or of the budget allocated thereto, in each year is open to producers located in other member states.
such indicative shares may, in each year, amount to at least 5 % from 2023 to 2026 and at least 10 % from 2027 to 2030, or, where lower, to the level of interconnectivity of the member state concerned in any given year.
in order to acquire further implementation experience, member states may organise one or more pilot schemes where support is open to producers located in other member states.
2.   member states may require proof of physical import of electricity from renewable sources. to that end, member states may limit participation in their support schemes to producers located in member states with which there is a direct connection via interconnectors. however, member states shall not change or otherwise affect cross-zonal schedules and capacity allocation due to producers participating in cross-border support schemes. cross-border electricity transfers shall be determined only by the outcome of capacity allocation pursuant to union law on the internal market in electricity.
3.   if a member state decides to open participation in support schemes to producers located in other member states, the relevant member states shall agree on the principles of such participation. such agreements shall cover at least the principles of allocation of renewable electricity that is the subject of cross-border support.
4.   the commission shall, upon the request of the relevant member states, assist them throughout the negotiation process with the setting up of cooperation arrangements by providing information and analysis, including quantitative and qualitative data on the direct and indirect costs and benefits of cooperation, as well as with guidance and technical expertise. the commission may encourage or facilitate the exchange of best practices and may develop templates for cooperation agreements in order to facilitate the negotiation process. the commission shall assess, by 2025, the costs and benefits of the deployment of electricity from renewable sources in the union pursuant to this article.
5.   by 2023, the commission shall carry out an evaluation of the implementation of this article. that evaluation shall assess the need to introduce an obligation on member states partially to open participation in their support schemes for electricity from renewable sources to producers located in other member states with a view to a 5 % opening by 2025 and a 10 % opening by 2030."""^^xsd:string ;

calculation of the share of energy from renewable sources
1.   the gross final consumption of energy from renewable sources in each member state shall be calculated as the sum of:
(a)
gross final consumption of electricity from renewable sources;
(b)
gross final consumption of energy from renewable sources in the heating and cooling sector; and
(c)
final consumption of energy from renewable sources in the transport sector.
with regard to point (a), (b), or (c) of the first subparagraph, gas, electricity and hydrogen from renewable sources shall be considered only once for the purposes of calculating the share of gross final consumption of energy from renewable sources.
subject to the second subparagraph of article 29(1), biofuels, bioliquids and biomass fuels that do not fulfil the sustainability and greenhouse gas emissions saving criteria laid down in article 29(2) to (7) and (10) shall not be taken into account.
2.   for the purposes of point (a) of the first subparagraph of paragraph 1, gross final consumption of electricity from renewable sources shall be calculated as the quantity of electricity produced in a member state from renewable sources, including the production of electricity from renewables self-consumers and renewable energy communities and excluding the production of electricity in pumped storage units from water that has previously been pumped uphill.
in multi-fuel plants using renewable and non-renewable sources, only the part of electricity produced from renewable sources shall be taken into account. for the purposes of that calculation, the contribution of each energy source shall be calculated on the basis of its energy content.
the electricity generated by hydropower and wind power shall be accounted for in accordance with the normalisation rules set out in annex ii.
3.   for the purposes of point (b) of the first subparagraph of paragraph 1, gross final consumption of energy from renewable sources in the heating and cooling sector shall be calculated as the quantity of district heating and cooling produced in a member state from renewable sources, plus the consumption of other energy from renewable sources in industry, households, services, agriculture, forestry and fisheries, for heating, cooling and processing purposes.
in multi-fuel plants using renewable and non-renewable sources, only the part of heating and cooling produced from renewable sources shall be taken into account. for the purposes of that calculation, the contribution of each energy source shall be calculated on the basis of its energy content.
ambient and geothermal energy used for heating and cooling by means of heat pumps and district cooling systems shall be taken into account for the purposes of point (b) of the first subparagraph of paragraph 1, provided that the final energy output significantly exceeds the primary energy input required to drive the heat pumps. the quantity of heat or cold to be considered to be energy from renewable sources for the purposes of this directive shall be calculated in accordance with the methodology set out in annex vii and shall take into account energy use in all end-use sectors.
thermal energy generated by passive energy systems, under which lower energy consumption is achieved passively through building design or from heat generated by energy from non-renewable sources, shall not be taken into account for the purposes of point (b) of the first subparagraph of paragraph 1.
by 31 december 2021, the commission shall adopt delegated acts in accordance with article 35 to supplement this directive by establishing a methodology for calculating the quantity of renewable energy used for cooling and district cooling and to amend annex vii.
that methodology shall include minimum seasonal performance factors for heat pumps operating in reverse mode.
4.   for the purposes of point (c) of the first subparagraph of paragraph 1, the following requirements shall apply:
(a)
final consumption of energy from renewable sources in the transport sector shall be calculated as the sum of all biofuels, biomass fuels and renewable liquid and gaseous transport fuels of non-biological origin consumed in the transport sector. however, renewable liquid and gaseous transport fuels of non-biological origin that are produced from renewable electricity shall be considered to be part of the calculation pursuant to point (a) of the first subparagraph of paragraph 1 only when calculating the quantity of electricity produced in a member state from renewable sources.
(b)
for the calculation of final consumption of energy in the transport sector, the values regarding the energy content of transport fuels, as set out in annex iii, shall be used. for the determination of the energy content of transport fuels not included in annex iii, member states shall use the relevant european standards organisation (eso) standards in order to determine the calorific values of fuels. where no eso standard has been adopted for that purpose, member states shall use the relevant international organization for standardisation (iso) standards.
5.   the share of energy from renewable sources shall be calculated as the gross final consumption of energy from renewable sources divided by the gross final consumption of energy from all energy sources, expressed as a percentage.
for the purposes of the first subparagraph of this paragraph, the sum referred to in the first subparagraph of paragraph 1 of this article shall be adjusted in accordance with articles 8, 10, 12 and 13.
in calculating a member state's gross final consumption of energy for the purposes of measuring its compliance with the targets and indicative trajectory laid down in this directive, the amount of energy consumed in aviation shall, as a proportion of that member state's gross final consumption of energy, be considered to be no more than 6,18 %. for cyprus and malta the amount of energy consumed in aviation shall, as a proportion of those member states' gross final consumption of energy, be considered to be no more than 4,12 %.
6.   the methodology and definitions used in the calculation of the share of energy from renewable sources shall be those provided for in regulation (ec) no 1099/2008.
member states shall ensure coherence of the statistical information used in calculating those sectoral and overall shares and of the statistical information reported to the commission pursuant to that regulation."""^^xsd:string ;

administrative procedures, regulations and codes
1.   member states shall ensure that any national rules concerning the authorisation, certification and licensing procedures that are applied to plants and associated transmission and distribution networks for the production of electricity, heating or cooling from renewable sources, to the process of transformation of biomass into biofuels, bioliquids, biomass fuels or other energy products, and to renewable liquid and gaseous transport fuels of non-biological origin are proportionate and necessary and contribute to the implementation of the energy efficiency first principle.
member states shall, in particular, take the appropriate steps to ensure that:
(a)
administrative procedures are streamlined and expedited at the appropriate administrative level and predictable timeframes are established for the procedures referred to in the first subparagraph;
(b)
rules concerning authorisation, certification and licensing are objective, transparent and proportionate, do not discriminate between applicants and take fully into account the particularities of individual renewable energy technologies;
(c)
administrative charges paid by consumers, planners, architects, builders and equipment and system installers and suppliers are transparent and cost-related; and
(d)
simplified and less burdensome authorisation procedures, including a simple-notification procedure, are established for decentralised devices, and for producing and storing energy from renewable sources.
2.   member states shall clearly define any technical specifications which are to be met by renewable energy equipment and systems in order to benefit from support schemes. where european standards exist, including eco-labels, energy labels and other technical reference systems established by the european standardisation bodies, such technical specifications shall be expressed in terms of those standards. such technical specifications shall not prescribe where the equipment and systems are to be certified and shall not impede the proper functioning of the internal market.
3.   member states shall ensure that their competent authorities at national, regional and local level include provisions for the integration and deployment of renewable energy, including for renewables self-consumption and renewable energy communities, and the use of unavoidable waste heat and cold when planning, including early spatial planning, designing, building and renovating urban infrastructure, industrial, commercial or residential areas and energy infrastructure, including electricity, district heating and cooling, natural gas and alternative fuel networks. member states shall, in particular, encourage local and regional administrative bodies to include heating and cooling from renewable sources in the planning of city infrastructure where appropriate, and to consult the network operators to reflect the impact of energy efficiency and demand response programs as well as specific provisions on renewables self-consumption and renewable energy communities, on the infrastructure development plans of the operators.
4.   member states shall introduce appropriate measures in their building regulations and codes in order to increase the share of all kinds of energy from renewable sources in the building sector.
in establishing such measures or in their support schemes, member states may take into account, where applicable, national measures relating to substantial increases in renewables self-consumption, in local energy storage and in energy efficiency, relating to cogeneration and relating to passive, low-energy or zero-energy buildings.
member states shall, in their building regulations and codes or by other means with equivalent effect, require the use of minimum levels of energy from renewable sources in new buildings and in existing buildings that are subject to major renovation in so far as technically, functionally and economically feasible, and reflecting the results of the cost-optimal calculation carried out pursuant to article 5(2) of directive 2010/31/eu, and in so far as this does not negatively affect indoor air quality. member states shall permit those minimum levels to be fulfilled, inter alia, through efficient district heating and cooling using a significant share of renewable energy and waste heat and cold.
the requirements laid down in the first subparagraph shall apply to the armed forces only to the extent that its application does not cause any conflict with the nature and primary aim of the activities of the armed forces and with the exception of material used exclusively for military purposes.
5.   member states shall ensure that new public buildings, and existing public buildings that are subject to major renovation, at national, regional and local level, fulfil an exemplary role in the context of this directive from 1 january 2012. member states may, inter alia, allow that obligation to be fulfilled by complying with nearly zero-energy building provisions as required in directive 2010/31/eu, or by providing for the roofs of public or mixed private-public buildings to be used by third parties for installations that produce energy from renewable sources.
6.   with respect to their building regulations and codes, member states shall promote the use of renewable heating and cooling systems and equipment that achieve a significant reduction of energy consumption. to that end, member states shall use energy or eco-labels or other appropriate certificates or standards developed at national or union level, where these exist, and ensure the provision of adequate information and advice on renewable, highly energy efficient alternatives as well as eventual financial instruments and incentives available in the case of replacement, with a view to promoting an increased replacement rate of old heating systems and an increased switch to solutions based on renewable energy in accordance with directive 2010/31/eu.
7.   member states shall carry out an assessment of their potential of energy from renewable sources and of the use of waste heat and cold in the heating and cooling sector. that assessment shall, where appropriate, include spatial analysis of areas suitable for low-ecological-risk deployment and the potential for small-scale household projects and shall be included in the second comprehensive assessment required pursuant to article 14(1) of directive 2012/27/eu for the first time by 31 december 2020 and in the subsequent updates of the comprehensive assessments.
8.   member states shall assess the regulatory and administrative barriers to long-term renewables power purchase agreements, and shall remove unjustified barriers to, and facilitate the uptake of, such agreements. member states shall ensure that those agreements are not subject to disproportionate or discriminatory procedures or charges.

guarantees of origin for energy from renewable sources
1.   for the purposes of demonstrating to final customers the share or quantity of energy from renewable sources in an energy supplier's energy mix and in the energy supplied to consumers under contracts marketed with reference to the consumption of energy from renewable sources, member states shall ensure that the origin of energy from renewable sources can be guaranteed as such within the meaning of this directive, in accordance with objective, transparent and non-discriminatory criteria.
2.   to that end, member states shall ensure that a guarantee of origin is issued in response to a request from a producer of energy from renewable sources, unless member states decide, for the purposes of accounting for the market value of the guarantee of origin, not to issue such a guarantee of origin to a producer that receives financial support from a support scheme. member states may arrange for guarantees of origin to be issued for energy from non-renewable sources. issuance of guarantees of origin may be made subject to a minimum capacity limit. a guarantee of origin shall be of the standard size of 1 mwh. no more than one guarantee of origin shall be issued in respect of each unit of energy produced.
member states shall ensure that the same unit of energy from renewable sources is taken into account only once.
member states shall ensure that when a producer receives financial support from a support scheme, the market value of the guarantee of origin for the same production is taken into account appropriately in the relevant support scheme.
it shall be presumed that the market value of the guarantee of origin has been taken into account appropriately in any of the following cases:
(a)
where the financial support is granted by way of a tendering procedure or a tradable green certificate system;
(b)
where the market value of the guarantees of origin is administratively taken into account in the level of financial support; or
(c)
where the guarantees of origin are not issued directly to the producer but to a supplier or consumer who buys the energy from renewable sources either in a competitive setting or in a long-term renewables power purchase agreement.
in order to take into account the market value of the guarantee of origin, member states may, inter alia, decide to issue a guarantee of origin to the producer and immediately cancel it.
the guarantee of origin shall have no function in terms of a member state's compliance with article 3. transfers of guarantees of origin, separately or together with the physical transfer of energy, shall have no effect on the decision of member states to use statistical transfers, joint projects or joint support schemes for compliance with article 3 or on the calculation of the gross final consumption of energy from renewable sources in accordance with article 7.
3.   for the purposes of paragraph 1, guarantees of origin shall be valid for 12 months after the production of the relevant energy unit. member states shall ensure that all guarantees of origin that have not been cancelled expire at the latest 18 months after the production of the energy unit. member states shall include expired guarantees of origin in the calculation of their residual energy mix.
4.   for the purposes of disclosure referred to in paragraphs 8 and 13, member states shall ensure that energy companies cancel guarantees of origin at the latest six months after the end of the validity of the guarantee of origin.
5.   member states or designated competent bodies shall supervise the issuance, transfer and cancellation of guarantees of origin. the designated competent bodies shall not have overlapping geographical responsibilities, and shall be independent of production, trade and supply activities.
6.   member states or the designated competent bodies shall put in place appropriate mechanisms to ensure that guarantees of origin are issued, transferred and cancelled electronically and are accurate, reliable and fraud-resistant. member states and designated competent bodies shall ensure that the requirements they impose comply with the standard cen - en 16325.
7.   a guarantee of origin shall specify at least:
(a)
the energy source from which the energy was produced and the start and end dates of production;
(b)
whether it relates to:
(i)
electricity;
(ii)
gas, including hydrogen; or
(iii)
heating or cooling;
(c)
the identity, location, type and capacity of the installation where the energy was produced;
(d)
whether the installation has benefited from investment support and whether the unit of energy has benefited in any other way from a national support scheme, and the type of support scheme;
(e)
the date on which the installation became operational; and
(f)
the date and country of issue and a unique identification number.
simplified information may be specified on guarantees of origin from installations of less than 50 kw.
8.   where an electricity supplier is required to demonstrate the share or quantity of energy from renewable sources in its energy mix for the purposes of point (a) of article 3(9) of directive 2009/72/ec, it shall do so by using guarantees of origin except:
(a)
as regards the share of its energy mix corresponding to non-tracked commercial offers, if any, for which the supplier may use the residual mix; or
(b)

mainstreaming renewable energy in heating and cooling
1.   in order to promote the use of renewable energy in the heating and cooling sector, each member state shall endeavour to increase the share of renewable energy in that sector by an indicative 1,3 percentage points as an annual average calculated for the periods 2021 to 2025 and 2026 to 2030, starting from the share of renewable energy in the heating and cooling sector in 2020, expressed in terms of national share of final energy consumption and calculated in accordance with the methodology set out in article 7, without prejudice to paragraph 2 of this article. that increase shall be limited to an indicative 1,1 percentage points for member states where waste heat and cold is not used. member states shall, where appropriate, prioritise the best available technologies.
2.   for the purposes of paragraph 1, when calculating its share of renewable energy in the heating and cooling sector and its average annual increase in accordance with that paragraph, each member state:
(a)
may count waste heat and cold, subject to a limit of 40 % of the average annual increase;
(b)
where its share of renewable energy in the heating and cooling sector is above 60 %, may count any such share as fulfilling the average annual increase; and
(c)
where its share of renewable energy in the heating and cooling sector is above 50 % and up to 60 %, may count any such share as fulfilling half of the average annual increase.
when deciding which measures to adopt for the purposes of deploying energy from renewable sources in the heating and cooling sector, member states may take into account cost-effectiveness reflecting structural barriers arising from the high share of natural gas or cooling, or from a dispersed settlement structure with low population density.
where those measures would result in a lower average annual increase than that referred to in paragraph 1 of this article, member states shall make it public, for instance by the means of their integrated national energy and climate progress reports pursuant to article 20 of regulation (eu) 2018/1999, and provide the commission with reasons, including of choice of measures as referred to the second subparagraph of this paragraph.
3.   on the basis of objective and non-discriminatory criteria, member states may establish and make public a list of measures and may designate and make public the implementing entities, such as fuel suppliers, public or professional bodies, which are to contribute to the average annual increase referred to in paragraph 1.
4.   member states may implement the average annual increase referred to in paragraph 1 by means, inter alia, of one or more of the following options:
(a)
physical incorporation of renewable energy or waste heat and cold in the energy and energy fuel supplied for heating and cooling;
(b)
direct mitigation measures such as the installation of highly efficient renewable heating and cooling systems in buildings, or the use of renewable energy or waste heat and cold in industrial heating and cooling processes;
(c)
indirect mitigation measures covered by tradable certificates proving compliance with the obligation laid down in paragraph 1 through support to indirect mitigation measures, carried out by another economic operator such as an independent renewable technology installer or energy service company providing renewable installation services;
(d)
other policy measures, with an equivalent effect, to reach the average annual increase referred to in paragraph 1, including fiscal measures or other financial incentives.
when adopting and implementing the measures referred to in the first subparagraph, member states shall aim to ensure the accessibility of measures to all consumers, in particular those in low-income or vulnerable households, who would not otherwise possess sufficient up-front capital to benefit.
5.   member states may use the structures established under the national energy savings obligations set out in article 7 of directive 2012/27/eu to implement and monitor the measures referred to in paragraph 3 of this article.
6.   where entities are designated under paragraph 3, member states shall ensure that the contribution by those designated entities is measurable and verifiable and that the designated entities report annually on:
(a)

1.   member states shall ensure that information on the energy performance and the share of renewable energy in their district heating and cooling systems is provided to final consumers in an easily accessible manner, such as on the suppliers' websites, on annual bills or upon request.
2.   member states shall lay down the necessary measures and conditions to allow customers of district heating or cooling systems which are not efficient district heating and cooling systems, or which are not such a system by 31 december 2025 on the basis of a plan approved by the competent authority, to disconnect by terminating or modifying their contract in order to produce heating or cooling from renewable sources themselves.
where the termination of a contract is linked to physical disconnection, such a termination may be made conditional on compensation for the costs directly incurred as a result of the physical disconnection and for the undepreciated portion of assets needed to provide heat and cold to that customer.
3.   member states may restrict the right to disconnect by terminating or modifying a contract in accordance with paragraph 2 to customers who can demonstrate that the planned alternative supply solution for heating or cooling results in a significantly better energy performance. the energy-performance assessment of the alternative supply solution may be based on the energy performance certificate.
4.   member states shall lay down the necessary measures to ensure that district heating and cooling systems contribute to the increase referred to in article 23(1) of this directive by implementing at least one of the two following options:
(a)
endeavour to increase the share of energy from renewable sources and from waste heat and cold in district heating and cooling by at least one percentage point as an annual average calculated for the period 2021 to 2025 and for the period 2026 to 2030, starting from the share of energy from renewable sources and from waste heat and cold in district heating and cooling in 2020, expressed in terms of share of final energy consumption in district heating and cooling, by implementing measures that can be expected to trigger that average annual increase in years with normal climatic conditions.
member states with a share of energy from renewable sources and from waste heat and cold in district heating and cooling above 60 % may count any such share as fulfilling the average annual increase referred to in the first subparagraph of this point.
member states shall lay down the necessary measures to implement the average annual increase referred to in the first subparagraph of this point in their integrated national energy and climate plans pursuant to annex i to regulation (eu) 2018/1999.
(b)
ensure that operators of district heating or cooling systems are obliged to connect suppliers of energy from renewable sources and from waste heat and cold or are obliged to offer to connect and purchase heat or cold from renewable sources and from waste heat and cold from third-party suppliers based on non-discriminatory criteria set by the competent authority of the member state concerned, where they need to do one or more of the following:
(i)
meet demand from new customers;
(ii)
replace existing heat or cold generation capacity;
(iii)
expand existing heat or cold generation capacity.
5.   where a member state exercises the option referred to in point (b) of paragraph 4, an operator of a district heating or cooling system may refuse to connect and to purchase heat or cold from a third-party supplier where:
(a)
the system lacks the necessary capacity due to other supplies of waste heat and cold, of heat or cold from renewable sources or of heat or cold produced by high-efficiency cogeneration;
(b)
the heat or cold from the third-party supplier does not meet the technical parameters necessary to connect and ensure the reliable and safe operation of the district heating and cooling system; or
(c)
the operator can demonstrate that providing access would lead to an excessive heat or cold cost increase for final customers compared to the cost of using the main local heat or cold supply with which the renewable source or waste heat and cold would compete.
member states shall ensure that, when an operator of a district heating or cooling system refuses to connect a supplier of heating or cooling pursuant to the first subparagraph, information on the reasons for the refusal, as well as the conditions to be met and measures to be taken in the system in order to enable the connection, is provided by that operator to the competent authority in accordance with paragraph 9.
6.   where a member state exercises the option referred to in point (b) of paragraph 4, it may exempt operators of the following district heating and cooling systems from the application of that point:
(a)
efficient district heating and cooling;
(b)
efficient district heating and cooling that exploits high-efficiency cogeneration;
(c)
district heating and cooling that, on the basis of a plan approved by the competent authority, is efficient district heating and cooling by 31 december 2025;
(d)
district heating and cooling with a total rated thermal input below 20 mw.
7.   the right to disconnect by terminating or modifying a contract in accordance with paragraph 2 may be exercised by individual customers, by joint undertakings formed by customers or by parties acting on behalf of customers. for multi-apartment blocks, such disconnection may be exercised only at a whole building level in accordance with the applicable housing law.
8.   member states shall require electricity distribution system operators to assess at least every four years, in cooperation with the operators of district heating or cooling systems in their respective area, the potential for district heating or cooling systems to provide balancing and other system services, including demand response and storing of excess electricity from renewable sources, and whether the use of the identified potential would be more resource- and cost-efficient than alternative solutions.
9.   member states shall ensure that the rights of consumers and the rules for operating district heating and cooling systems in accordance with this article are clearly defined and enforced by the competent authority.
10.   a member state shall not be required to apply paragraphs 2 to 9 of this article where:
(a)
its share of district heating and cooling is less than or equal to 2 % of the overall consumption of energy in heating and cooling on 24 december 2018;
(b)

specific rules for biofuels, bioliquids and biomass fuels produced from food and feed crops
1.   for the calculation of a member state's gross final consumption of energy from renewable sources referred to in article 7 and the minimum share referred to in the first subparagraph of article 25(1), the share of biofuels and bioliquids, as well as of biomass fuels consumed in transport, where produced from food and feed crops, shall be no more than one percentage point higher than the share of such fuels in the final consumption of energy in the road and rail transport sectors in 2020 in that member state, with a maximum of 7 % of final consumption of energy in the road and rail transport sectors in that member state.
where that share is below 1 % in a member state, it may be increased to a maximum of 2 % of the final consumption of energy in the road and rail transport sectors.
member states may set a lower limit and may distinguish, for the purposes of article 29(1), between different biofuels, bioliquids and biomass fuels produced from food and feed crops, taking into account best available evidence on indirect land-use change impact. member states may, for example, set a lower limit for the share of biofuels, bioliquids and biomass fuels produced from oil crops.
where the share of biofuels and bioliquids, as well as of biomass fuels consumed in transport, produced from food and feed crops in a member state is limited to a share lower than 7 % or a member state decides to limit the share further, that member state may reduce the minimum share referred to in the first subparagraph of article 25(1) accordingly, by a maximum of 7 percentage points.
2.   for the calculation of a member state's gross final consumption of energy from renewable sources referred to in article 7 and the minimum share referred to in the first subparagraph of article 25(1), the share of high indirect land-use change-risk biofuels, bioliquids or biomass fuels produced from food and feed crops for which a significant expansion of the production area into land with high-carbon stock is observed shall not exceed the level of consumption of such fuels in that member state in 2019, unless they are certified to be low indirect land-use change-risk biofuels, bioliquids or biomass fuels pursuant to this paragraph.
from 31 december 2023 until 31 december 2030 at the latest, that limit shall gradually decrease to 0 %.
by 1 february 2019, the commission shall submit to the european parliament and to the council a report on the status of worldwide production expansion of the relevant food and feed crops.
by 1 february 2019, the commission shall adopt a delegated act in accordance with article 35 to supplement this directive by setting out the criteria for certification of low indirect land-use change-risk biofuels, bioliquids and biomass fuels and for determining the high indirect land-use change-risk feedstock for which a significant expansion of the production area into land with high-carbon stock is observed. the report and the accompanying delegated act shall be based on the best available scientific data.
by 1 september 2023, the commission shall review the criteria laid down in the delegated act referred to in the fourth subparagraph based on the best available scientific data and shall adopt delegated acts in accordance with article 35 to amend such criteria, where appropriate, and to include a trajectory to gradually decrease the contribution to the union target set in article 3(1) and to the minimum share referred to in the first subparagraph of article 25(1), of high indirect land-use change-risk biofuels, bioliquids and biomass fuels produced from feedstock for which a significant expansion of the production into land with high-carbon stock is observed."""^^xsd:string ;

calculation rules with regard to the minimum shares of renewable energy in the transport sector
1.   for the calculation of the minimum shares referred to in the first and fourth subparagraphs of article 25(1), the following provisions shall apply:
(a)
for the calculation of the denominator, that is the energy content of road- and rail- transport fuels supplied for consumption or use on the market, petrol, diesel, natural gas, biofuels, biogas, renewable liquid and gaseous transport fuels of non-biological origin, recycled carbon fuels and electricity supplied to the road and rail transport sectors, shall be taken into account;
(b)
for the calculation of the numerator, that is the amount of energy from renewable sources consumed in the transport sector for the purposes of the first subparagraph of article 25(1), the energy content of all types of energy from renewable sources supplied to all transport sectors, including renewable electricity supplied to the road and rail transport sectors, shall be taken into account. member states may also take into account recycled carbon fuels.
for the calculation of the numerator, the share of biofuels and biogas produced from the feedstock listed in part b of annex ix shall, except for in cyprus and malta, be limited to 1,7 % of the energy content of transport fuels supplied for consumption or use on the market. member states may, where justified, modify that limit, taking into account the availability of feedstock. any such modification shall be subject to approval by the commission;
(c)
for the calculation of both numerator and denominator, the values regarding the energy content of transport fuels set out in annex iii shall be used. for the determination of the energy content of transport fuels not included in annex iii, the member states shall use the relevant eso standards for the determination of the calorific values of fuels. where no eso standard has been adopted for that purpose, the relevant iso standards shall be used. the commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with article 35 to amend this directive by adapting the energy content of transport fuels, as set out in annex iii, in accordance with scientific and technical progress.
2.   for the purposes of demonstrating compliance with the minimum shares referred to in article 25(1):
(a)
the share of biofuels and biogas for transport produced from the feedstock listed in annex ix may be considered to be twice its energy content;
(b)
the share of renewable electricity shall be considered to be four times its energy content when supplied to road vehicles and may be considered to be 1,5 times its energy content when supplied to rail transport;
(c)
with the exception of fuels produced from food and feed crops, the share of fuels supplied in the aviation and maritime sectors shall be considered to be 1,2 times their energy content.
3.   for the calculation of the share of renewable electricity in the electricity supplied to road and rail vehicles for the purposes of paragraph 1 of this article, member states shall refer to the two-year period before the year in which the electricity is supplied in their territory.
by way of derogation from the first subparagraph of this paragraph, to determine the share of electricity for the purposes of paragraph 1 of this article, in the case of electricity obtained from a direct connection to an installation generating renewable electricity and supplied to road vehicles, that electricity shall be fully counted as renewable.
in order to ensure that the expected increase in demand for electricity in the transport sector beyond the current baseline is met with additional renewable energy generation capacity, the commission shall develop a framework on additionality in the transport sector and shall develop different options with a view to determining the baseline of member states and measuring additionality.
for the purposes of this paragraph, where electricity is used for the production of renewable liquid and gaseous transport fuels of non-biological origin, either directly or for the production of intermediate products, the average share of electricity from renewable sources in the country of production, as measured two years before the year in question, shall be used to determine the share of renewable energy.
however, electricity obtained from direct connection to an installation generating renewable electricity may be fully counted as renewable electricity where it is used for the production of renewable liquid and gaseous transport fuels of non-biological origin, provided that the installation:
(a)
comes into operation after, or at the same time as, the installation producing the renewable liquid and gaseous transport fuels of non-biological origin; and
(b)
is not connected to the grid or is connected to the grid but evidence can be provided that the electricity concerned has been supplied without taking electricity from the grid.
electricity that has been taken from the grid may be counted as fully renewable provided that it is produced exclusively from renewable sources and the renewable properties and other appropriate criteria have been demonstrated, ensuring that the renewable properties of that electricity are claimed only once and only in one end-use sector.
by 31 december 2021, the commission shall adopt a delegated act in accordance with article 35 to supplement this directive by establishing a union methodology setting out detailed rules by which economic operators are to comply with the requirements laid down in the fifth and sixth subparagraphs of this paragraph."""^^xsd:string ;

other provisions on renewable energy in the transport sector
1.   with a view to minimising the risk of single consignments being claimed more than once in the union, member states and the commission shall strengthen cooperation among national systems and between national systems and voluntary schemes and verifiers established pursuant to article 30, including, where appropriate, the exchange of data. where the competent authority of one member state suspects or detects a fraud, it shall, where appropriate, inform the other member states.
2.   the commission shall ensure that a union database is put in place to enable the tracing of liquid and gaseous transport fuels that are eligible for being counted towards the numerator referred to in point (b) of article 27(1) or that are taken into account for the purposes referred to in points (a), (b), and (c) of the first subparagraph of article 29(1). member states shall require the relevant economic operators to enter into that database information on the transactions made and the sustainability characteristics of those fuels, including their life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions, starting from their point of production to the fuel supplier that places the fuel on the market. a member state may set up a national database that is linked to the union database ensuring that information entered is instantly transferred between the databases.
fuel suppliers shall enter the information necessary to verify compliance with the requirements laid down in the first and fourth subparagraphs of article 25(1) into the relevant database.
3.   by 31 december 2021, member states shall take measures to ensure the availability of fuels from renewable sources for transport including with regard to publicly accessible high-power recharging points and other refuelling infrastructure as provided for in their national policy frameworks in accordance with directive 2014/94/eu.
4.   member states shall have access to the union database referred to in paragraph 2 of this article. they shall take measures to ensure that economic operators enter accurate information into the relevant database. the commission shall require the schemes that are the subject of a decision pursuant to article 30(4) of this directive to verify compliance with that requirement when checking compliance with the sustainability criteria for biofuels, bioliquids and biomass fuels. it shall publish, every two years, aggregated information from the union database pursuant to annex viii to regulation (eu) 2018/1999.
5.   by 31 december 2021, the commission shall adopt delegated acts in accordance with article 35 to supplement this directive by specifying the methodology to determine the share of biofuel, and biogas for transport, resulting from biomass being processed with fossil fuels in a common process, and by specifying the methodology for assessing greenhouse gas emissions savings from renewable liquid and gaseous transport fuels of non-biological origin and from recycled carbon fuels, which shall ensure that credit for avoided emissions is not given for co2 the capture of which has already received an emission credit under other provisions of law.
6.   by 25 june 2019 and every two years thereafter, the commission shall review the list of feedstock set out in parts a and b of annex ix with a view to adding feedstock in accordance with the principles set out in the third subparagraph.
the commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with article 35 to amend the list of feedstock set out in parts a and b of annex ix by adding, but not removing, feedstock. feedstock that can be processed only with advanced technologies shall be added to part a of annex ix. feedstock that can be processed into biofuels, or biogas for transport, with mature technologies shall be added to part b of annex ix.
such delegated acts shall be based on an analysis of the potential of the raw material as feedstock for the production of biofuels and biogas for transport, taking into account all of the following:
(a)
the principles of the circular economy and of the waste hierarchy established in directive 2008/98/ec;
(b)
the union sustainability criteria laid down in article 29(2) to (7);
(c)
the need to avoid significant distortive effects on markets for (by-)products, wastes or residues;
(d)
the potential for delivering substantial greenhouse gas emissions savings compared to fossil fuels based on a life-cycle assessment of emissions;
(e)
the need to avoid negative impacts on the environment and biodiversity;
(f)
the need to avoid creating an additional demand for land.
7.   by 31 december 2025, in the context of the biennial assessment of progress made pursuant to regulation (eu) 2018/1999, the commission shall assess whether the obligation relating to advanced biofuels and biogas produced from feedstock listed in part a of annex ix laid down in the fourth subparagraph of article 25(1) effectively stimulates innovation and ensures greenhouse gas emissions savings in the transport sector. the commission shall analyse in that assessment whether the application of this article effectively avoids double accounting of renewable energy.
the commission shall, if appropriate, submit a proposal to amend the obligation relating to advanced biofuels and biogas produced from feedstock listed in part a of annex ix laid down in the fourth subparagraph of article 25(1)."""^^xsd:string ;

at least 70 % for electricity, heating and cooling production from biomass fuels used in installations starting operation from 1 january 2021 until 31 december 2025, and 80 % for installations starting operation from 1 january 2026.
an installation shall be considered to be in operation once the physical production of biofuels, biogas consumed in the transport sector and bioliquids, and the physical production of heating and cooling and electricity from biomass fuels has started.
the greenhouse gas emission savings from the use of biofuels, biogas consumed in the transport sector, bioliquids and biomass fuels used in installations producing heating, cooling and electricity shall be calculated in accordance with article 31(1).
11.   electricity from biomass fuels shall be taken into account for the purposes referred to in points (a), (b) and (c) of the first subparagraph of paragraph 1 only if it meets one or more of the following requirements:
(a)
it is produced in installations with a total rated thermal input below 50 mw;
(b)
for installations with a total rated thermal input from 50 to 100 mw, it is produced applying high-efficiency cogeneration technology, or, for electricity-only installations, meeting an energy efficiency level associated with the best available techniques (bat-aeels) as defined in commission implementing decision (eu) 2017/1442 (26);
(c)
for installations with a total rated thermal input above 100 mw, it is produced applying high-efficiency cogeneration technology, or, for electricity-only installations, achieving an net-electrical efficiency of at least 36 %;
(d)
it is produced applying biomass co2 capture and storage.
for the purposes of points (a), (b) and (c) of the first subparagraph of paragraph 1 of this article, electricity-only-installations shall be taken into account only if they do not use fossil fuels as a main fuel and only if there is no cost-effective potential for the application of high-efficiency cogeneration technology according to the assessment in accordance with article 14 of directive 2012/27/eu.
for the purposes of points (a) and (b) of the first subparagraph of paragraph 1 of this article, this paragraph shall apply only to installations starting operation or converted to the use of biomass fuels after 25 december 2021. for the purposes of point (c) of the first subparagraph of paragraph 1 of this article, this paragraph shall be without prejudice to support granted under support schemes in accordance with article 4 approved by 25 december 2021.
member states may apply higher energy efficiency requirements than those referred in the first subparagraph to installations with lower rated thermal input.
the first subparagraph shall not apply to electricity from installations which are the object of a specific notification by a member state to the commission based on the duly substantiated existence of risks for the security of supply of electricity. upon assessment of the notification, the commission shall adopt a decision taking into account the elements included therein.
12.   for the purposes referred to in points (a), (b) and (c) of the first subparagraph of paragraph 1 of this article, and without prejudice to articles 25 and 26, member states shall not refuse to take into account, on other sustainability grounds, biofuels and bioliquids obtained in compliance with this article. this paragraph shall be without prejudice to public support granted under support schemes approved before 24 december 2018.

(a)
installations located in an outermost region as referred to in article 349 tfeu to the extent that such facilities produce electricity or heating or cooling from biomass fuels; and
(b)
biomass fuels used in the installations referred to in point (a) of this subparagraph, irrespective of the place of origin of that biomass, provided that such criteria are objectively justified on the grounds that their aim is to ensure, for that outermost region, a smooth phase-in of the criteria laid down in paragraphs 2 to 7 and 10 and 11 of this article and thereby incentivise the transition from fossil fuels to sustainable biomass fuels.
the different criteria referred to in this paragraph shall be subject to a specific notification by the relevant member state to the commission.
14.   for the purposes referred to in points (a), (b) and (c) of the first subparagraph of paragraph 1, member states may establish additional sustainability criteria for biomass fuels.

verification of compliance with the sustainability and greenhouse gas emissions saving criteria
1.   where biofuels, bioliquids and biomass fuels, or other fuels that are eligible for counting towards the numerator referred to in point (b) of article 27(1), are to be taken into account for the purposes referred to in articles 23 and 25 and in points (a), (b) and (c) of the first subparagraph of article 29(1), member states shall require economic operators to show that the sustainability and greenhouse gas emissions saving criteria laid down in article 29(2) to (7) and (10) have been fulfilled. for those purposes, they shall require economic operators to use a mass balance system which:
(a)
allows consignments of raw material or fuels with differing sustainability and greenhouse gas emissions saving characteristics to be mixed for instance in a container, processing or logistical facility, transmission and distribution infrastructure or site;
(b)
allows consignments of raw material with differing energy content to be mixed for the purposes of further processing, provided that the size of consignments is adjusted according to their energy content;
(c)
requires information about the sustainability and greenhouse gas emissions saving characteristics and sizes of the consignments referred to in point (a) to remain assigned to the mixture; and
(d)
provides for the sum of all consignments withdrawn from the mixture to be described as having the same sustainability characteristics, in the same quantities, as the sum of all consignments added to the mixture and requires that this balance be achieved over an appropriate period of time.
the mass balance system shall ensure that each consignment is counted only once in point (a), (b) or (c) of the first subparagraph of article 7(1) for the purposes of calculating the gross final consumption of energy from renewable sources and shall include information on whether support has been provided for the production of that consignment, and if so, on the type of support scheme.
2.   where a consignment is processed, information on the sustainability and greenhouse gas emissions saving characteristics of the consignment shall be adjusted and assigned to the output in accordance with the following rules:
(a)
when the processing of a consignment of raw material yields only one output that is intended for the production of biofuels, bioliquids or biomass fuels, renewable liquid and gaseous transport fuels of non-biological origin, or recycled carbon fuels, the size of the consignment and the related quantities of sustainability and greenhouse gas emissions saving characteristics shall be adjusted applying a conversion factor representing the ratio between the mass of the output that is intended for such production and the mass of the raw material entering the process;
(b)
when the processing of a consignment of raw material yields more than one output that is intended for the production of biofuels, bioliquids or biomass fuels, renewable liquid and gaseous transport fuels of non-biological origin, or recycled carbon fuels, for each output a separate conversion factor shall be applied and a separate mass balance shall be used.
3.   member states shall take measures to ensure that economic operators submit reliable information regarding the compliance with the greenhouse gas emissions savings thresholds set in, and adopted pursuant to, article 25(2), and with the sustainability and greenhouse gas emissions saving criteria laid down in article 29(2) to (7) and (10), and that economic operators make available to the relevant member state, upon request, the data that were used to develop the information. member states shall require economic operators to arrange for an adequate standard of independent auditing of the information submitted, and to provide evidence that this has been done. in order to comply with point (a) of article 29(6) and point (a) of article 29(7), the first or second party auditing may be used up to the first gathering point of the forest biomass. the auditing shall verify that the systems used by economic operators are accurate, reliable and protected against fraud, including verification ensuring that materials are not intentionally modified or discarded so that the consignment or part thereof could become a waste or residue. it shall evaluate the frequency and methodology of sampling and the robustness of the data.
the obligations laid down in this paragraph shall apply regardless of whether the biofuels, bioliquids, biomass fuels, renewable liquid and gaseous transport fuels of non-biological origin, or recycled carbon fuels are produced within the union or are imported. information about the geographic origin and feedstock type of biofuels, bioliquids and biomass fuels per fuel supplier shall be made available to consumers on the websites of operators, suppliers or the relevant competent authorities and shall be updated on an annual basis.
member states shall submit to the commission, in aggregated form, the information referred to in the first subparagraph of this paragraph. the commission shall publish that information on the e-reporting platform referred to in article 28 of regulation (eu) 2018/1999 in summary form preserving the confidentiality of commercially sensitive information.
4.   the commission may decide that voluntary national or international schemes setting standards for the production of biofuels, bioliquids or biomass fuels, or other fuels that are eligible for counting towards the numerator referred to in point (b) of article 27(1), provide accurate data on greenhouse gas emission savings for the purposes of article 25(2) and article 29(10), demonstrate compliance with article 27(3) and article 28(2) and (4), or demonstrate that consignments of biofuels, bioliquids or biomass fuels comply with the sustainability criteria laid down in article 29(2) to (7). when demonstrating that the criteria laid down in article 29(6) and (7) are met, the operators may provide the required evidence directly at sourcing area level. the commission may recognise areas for the protection of rare, threatened or endangered ecosystems or species recognised by international agreements or included in lists drawn up by intergovernmental organisations or the international union for the conservation of nature for the purposes of point (c)(ii) of the first subparagraph of article 29(3).
the commission may decide that those schemes contain accurate information on measures taken for soil, water and air protection, for the restoration of degraded land, for the avoidance of excessive water consumption in areas where water is scarce, and for certification of biofuels, bioliquids and biomass fuels with low indirect land-use change-risk.
5.   the commission shall adopt decisions under paragraph 4 of this article by means of implementing acts. those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in article 34(3). such decisions shall be valid for a period of no more than five years.
the commission shall require that each voluntary scheme on which a decision has been adopted under paragraph 4 submit annually by 30 april a report to the commission covering each of the points set out in annex ix to regulation (eu) 2018/1999. the report shall cover the preceding calendar year. the requirement to submit a report shall apply only to voluntary schemes that have operated for at least 12 months.
the commission shall make the reports drawn up by the voluntary schemes available, in an aggregated form or in full if appropriate, on the e-reporting platform referred to in article 28 of regulation (eu) 2018/1999.
6.   member states may set up national schemes where compliance with the sustainability and greenhouse gas emissions saving criteria laid down in article 29(2) to (7) and (10) and with the greenhouse gas emissions savings thresholds for renewable liquid and gaseous transport fuels of non-biological origin and recycled carbon fuels set in, and adopted pursuant to, article 25(2) and in accordance with article 28(5) is verified throughout the entire chain of custody involving competent national authorities.
a member state may notify such a national scheme to the commission. the commission shall give priority to the assessment of such a scheme in order to facilitate mutual bilateral and multilateral recognition of schemes for verification of compliance with the sustainability and greenhouse gas emissions saving criteria for biofuels, bioliquids and biomass fuels and with the greenhouse gas emissions savings thresholds for other fuels that are eligible for counting towards the numerator referred to in point (b) of article 27(1). the commission may decide, by means of implementing acts, whether such a notified national scheme complies with the conditions laid down in this directive. those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in article 34(3).
where the decision is positive, schemes established in accordance with this article shall not refuse mutual recognition with that member state's scheme, as regards verification of compliance with the sustainability and greenhouse gas emissions saving criteria laid down in article 29(2) to (7) and (10) and the greenhouse gas emissions savings thresholds set in, and adopted pursuant to, article 25(2).
7.   the commission shall adopt decisions under paragraph 4 of this article only if the scheme in question meets adequate standards of reliability, transparency and independent auditing and provides adequate assurances that no materials have been intentionally modified or discarded so that the consignment or part thereof would fall under annex ix. in the case of schemes to measure greenhouse gas emissions savings, such schemes shall also comply with the methodological requirements set out in annex v or vi. lists of areas of high biodiversity value as referred to in point (c)(ii) of the first subparagraph of article 29(3) shall meet adequate standards of objectivity and coherence with internationally recognised standards and provide for appropriate appeal procedures.
the voluntary schemes referred to in paragraph 4 shall, at least annually, publish a list of their certification bodies used for independent auditing, indicating for each certification body by which entity or national public authority it was recognised and which entity or national public authority is monitoring it.
8.   in order to ensure that compliance with the sustainability and greenhouse gas emissions saving criteria as well as with the provisions on low or high direct and indirect land-use change-risk biofuels, bioliquids and biomass fuels is verified in an efficient and harmonised manner and in particular to prevent fraud, the commission shall adopt implementing acts specifying detailed implementing rules, including adequate standards of reliability, transparency and independent auditing and require all voluntary schemes to apply those standards. those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in article 34(3).
in those implementing acts, the commission shall pay particular attention to the need to minimise administrative burden. the implementing acts shall set a time frame by which voluntary schemes are required to implement the standards. the commission may repeal decisions recognising voluntary schemes pursuant to paragraph 4 in the event that those schemes fail to implement such standards in the time frame provided for. where a member state raises concerns that a voluntary scheme does not operate in accordance with the standards of reliability, transparency and independent auditing that constitute the basis for decisions under paragraph 4, the commission shall investigate the matter and take appropriate action.
9.   where an economic operator provides evidence or data obtained in accordance with a scheme that has been the subject of a decision pursuant to paragraph 4 or 6 of this article, to the extent covered by that decision, a member state shall not require the supplier to provide further evidence of compliance with the sustainability and greenhouse gas emissions saving criteria laid down in article 29(2) to (7) and (10).
competent authorities of the member states shall supervise the operation of certification bodies that are conducting independent auditing under a voluntary scheme. certification bodies shall submit, upon the request of competent authorities, all relevant information necessary to supervise the operation, including the exact date, time and location of audits. where member states find issues of non-conformity, they shall inform the voluntary scheme without delay.
10.   at the request of a member state, which may be based on the request of an economic operator, the commission shall, on the basis of all available evidence, examine whether the sustainability and greenhouse gas emissions saving criteria laid down in article 29(2) to (7) and (10) in relation to a source of biofuels, bioliquids and biomass fuels, and the greenhouse gas emissions savings thresholds set in, and adopted pursuant to, article 25(2), have been met.
within six months of receipt of such a request and in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in article 34(3), the commission shall, by means of implementing acts, decide whether the member state concerned may either:
(a)
take into account biofuels, bioliquids, biomass fuels and other fuels that are eligible for counting towards the numerator referred to in point (b) of article 27(1) from that source for the purposes referred to in points (a), (b) and (c) of the first subparagraph of article 29(1); or
(b)
by way of derogation from paragraph 9 of this article, require suppliers of the source of biofuels, bioliquids, biomass fuels and other fuels that are eligible for counting towards the numerator referred to in point (b) of article 27(1) to provide further evidence of compliance with those sustainability and greenhouse gas emissions saving criteria and those greenhouse gas emissions savings thresholds."""^^xsd:string ;

calculation of the greenhouse gas impact of biofuels, bioliquids and biomass fuels
1.   for the purposes of article 29(10), the greenhouse gas emissions saving from the use of biofuel, bioliquids and biomass fuels shall be calculated in one of the following ways:
(a)
where a default value for greenhouse gas emissions saving for the production pathway is laid down in part a or b of annex v for biofuels and bioliquids and in part a of annex vi for biomass fuels where the el value for those biofuels or bioliquids calculated in accordance with point 7 of part c of annex v and for those biomass fuels calculated in accordance with point 7 of part b of annex vi is equal to or less than zero, by using that default value;
(b)
by using an actual value calculated in accordance with the methodology laid down in part c of annex v for biofuels and bioliquids and in part b of annex vi for biomass fuels;
(c)
by using a value calculated as the sum of the factors of the formulas referred to in point 1 of part c of annex v, where disaggregated default values in part d or e of annex v may be used for some factors, and actual values, calculated in accordance with the methodology laid down in part c of annex v, are used for all other factors;
(d)
by using a value calculated as the sum of the factors of the formulas referred to in point 1 of part b of annex vi, where disaggregated default values in part c of annex vi may be used for some factors, and actual values, calculated in accordance with the methodology laid down in part b of annex vi, are used for all other factors.
2.   member states may submit to the commission reports including information on the typical greenhouse gas emissions from the cultivation of agricultural raw materials of the areas on their territory classified as level 2 in the nomenclature of territorial units for statistics (nuts) or as a more disaggregated nuts level in accordance with regulation (ec) no 1059/2003 of the european parliament and of the council (27). those reports shall be accompanied by a description of the method and data sources used to calculate the level of emissions. that method shall take into account soil characteristics, climate and expected raw material yields.
3.   in the case of territories outside the union, reports equivalent to those referred to in paragraph 2 and drawn up by competent bodies may be submitted to the commission.
4.   the commission may, by means of implementing acts, decide that the reports referred to in paragraphs 2 and 3 of this article contain accurate data for the purposes of measuring the greenhouse gas emissions associated with the cultivation of agriculture biomass feedstock produced in the areas included in such reports for the purposes of article 29(10). those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in article 34(3).
those data may, pursuant to such decisions, be used instead of the disaggregated default values for cultivation laid down in part d or e of annex v for biofuels and bioliquids and in part c of annex vi for biomass fuels.
5.   the commission shall review annexes v and vi with a view, where justified, to adding or revising values for biofuel, bioliquid and biomass fuel production pathways. those reviews shall also consider modifying the methodology laid down in part c of annex v and in part b of annex vi.
the commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts pursuant to article 35 to amend, where appropriate, annexes v and vi by adding or revising the default values or modifying the methodology.
in the case of an adaptation of, or addition to, the list of default values in annexes v and vi:
(a)
where the contribution of a factor to overall emissions is small, where there is limited variation, or where the cost or difficulty of establishing actual values is high, the default values shall be typical of normal production processes;
(b)
in all other cases, the default values shall be conservative compared to normal production processes.
6.   where necessary in order to ensure the uniform application of part c of annex v and part b of annex vi, the commission may adopt implementing acts setting out detailed technical specifications including definitions, conversion factors, the calculation of annual cultivation emissions or emission savings caused by changes above and below-ground carbon stocks on already cultivated land, the calculation of emission savings from co2 capture, co2 replacement and co2 geological storage. those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in article 34(3)."""^^xsd:string ;

subject matter and scope
1.   this regulation establishes a governance mechanism to:
(a)
implement strategies and measures designed to meet the objectives and targets of the energy union and the long-term union greenhouse gas emissions commitments consistent with the paris agreement, and for the first ten-year period, from 2021 to 2030, in particular the union's 2030 targets for energy and climate;
(b)
stimulate cooperation between member states, including, where appropriate, at regional level, designed to achieve the objectives and targets of the energy union;
(c)
ensure the timeliness, transparency, accuracy, consistency, comparability and completeness of reporting by the union and its member states to the unfccc and paris agreement secretariat;
(d)
contribute to greater regulatory certainty as well as contribute to greater investor certainty and help take full advantage of opportunities for economic development, investment stimulation, job creation and social cohesion.
the governance mechanism is based on long-term strategies, integrated national energy and climate plans covering ten-year periods starting from 2021 to 2030, corresponding integrated national energy and climate progress reports by the member states and integrated monitoring arrangements by the commission. the governance mechanism ensures effective opportunities for the public to participate in the preparation of those national plans and those long-term strategies. it comprises a structured, transparent, iterative process between the commission and member states for the purpose of the finalisation of the integrated national energy and climate plans and their subsequent implementation, including with regard to regional cooperation, and corresponding commission action.
2.   this regulation applies to the five dimensions of the energy union, which are closely related and mutually reinforcing:
(a)
energy security;
(b)
internal energy market;
(c)
energy efficiency;
(d)
decarbonisation; and

without prejudice to the other provisions of this article, and for the sole purpose of assessing whether a gap between the union's 2030 target and the collective contributions of member states occurs, the commission shall, in its assessment, assume a national contribution of the member states which did not submit their draft integrated national energy and climate plans in accordance with article 9(1).
in its assumption, in the area of renewable energy, the commission shall take into account the member state's national binding target for 2020 as set out in annex i to directive (eu) 2018/2001, results from modelling exercises on renewable energy development and the results from the formula set out in annex ii to this regulation. in the area of energy efficiency, it shall take into account modelling exercises in relation to future trends in energy consumption and other complementary analysis as appropriate.
in its assessment of the renewable energy contributions, based on the formula set out in annex ii, the commission shall take into consideration any potential negative impacts on the security of supply and grid stability in small or isolated energy systems or in member states' systems where there may be significant implications due to the change of synchronous area.

response to insufficient progress towards the union's energy and climate objectives and targets
1.   where, on the basis of its assessment pursuant to point (b) of article 29(1), the commission concludes that insufficient progress is made by a member state towards meeting its objectives, targets and contributions, its reference points for renewable energy, or in implementing the policies and measures set out in its integrated national climate and energy plan, it shall issue recommendations to the member state concerned pursuant to article 34.
in its recommendations in the area of renewable energy, the commission shall take into consideration the relevant circumstances indicated by the member state in accordance with the second subparagraph of article 5(1). the commission shall also take into consideration renewable energy projects for which a final investment decision has been taken, provided that those projects become operational in the period 2021 to 2030 and have a significant impact on a member state's national contribution.
in its recommendations in the area of energy efficiency, the commission shall take due account of the objective criteria listed in points (a) and (b) of article 6(1) and the relevant national circumstances indicated by the member state in accordance with article 6(2).
2.   where, on the basis of its aggregate assessment of member states' integrated national energy and climate progress reports pursuant to point (a) of article 29(1), and supported by other information sources, as appropriate, the commission concludes that the union is at risk of not meeting the objectives of the energy union and, in particular, for the first ten-year period, the targets of the union's 2030 framework for climate and energy, it may issue recommendations to all member states pursuant to article 34 to mitigate such a risk.
in the area of renewable energy, the commission shall assess if the national measures provided for in paragraph 3 are sufficient to achieve the union's renewable energy targets. in the case of insufficient national measures, the commission shall, as appropriate, propose measures and exercise its power at union level in addition to those recommendations in order to ensure, in particular, the achievement of the union's 2030 target for renewable energy.

2.   without prejudice to paragraph 1 of this article, the financing mechanism shall contribute to the enabling framework pursuant to article 3(4) of directive (eu) 2018/2001 with the aim of supporting renewable energy deployment across the union irrespectively of a gap to the indicative union trajectory. to that end:
(a)
payments from member states referred to in article 32 may be complemented by additional sources, such as union funds, private sector contributions or additional payments by member states in order to contribute to the achievement of the union target;
(b)
the financing mechanism may, inter alia, provide support in the form of low-interest loans, grants, or a mix of both and may support, inter alia, joint projects between member states in accordance with article 9 of directive (eu) 2018/2001 and member states' participation in joint projects with third countries referred to in article 11 of that directive.
3.   member states shall retain the right to decide whether, and if so, under which conditions, they allow installations located on their territory to receive support from the financing mechanism.
4.   the commission, assisted by the energy union committee referred to in point (b) of article 44(1), may adopt implementing acts to set out the necessary provisions for the establishment and functioning of the financing mechanism, in particular:
(a)
the methodology for the calculation of the maximum level of the premium for each tender;
(b)
the tender design to be applied, including conditions for delivery and associated penalties;
(c)
the methodology for the calculation of the payments of member states and the resulting statistical benefits for the contributing member states;
(d)
minimum requirements for member states' participation, having regard to the need to ensure both continuity of the mechanism by means of a sufficient duration of the member state payment, as well as the maximum amount of flexibility for member states' participation;
(e)
provisions ensuring the participation and/or approval of hosting member states, and where necessary provisions relating to additional system cost charges.
those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in article 44(6).
5.   every year, renewable energy generated by installations financed by the financing mechanism shall be statistically attributed to the participating member states, reflecting their relative payments. projects supported by this financing mechanism that are financed by other sources than member states payments shall not count towards member states' national contributions but towards the union binding target pursuant to article 3(1) of directive (eu) 2018/2001."""^^xsd:string ;

subject matter
this directive establishes common rules for the generation, transmission, distribution, energy storage and supply of electricity, together with consumer protection provisions, with a view to creating truly integrated competitive, consumer-centred, flexible, fair and transparent electricity markets in the union.
using the advantages of an integrated market, this directive aims to ensure affordable, transparent energy prices and costs for consumers, a high degree of security of supply and a smooth transition towards a sustainable low-carbon energy system. it lays down key rules relating to the organisation and functioning of the union electricity sector, in particular rules on consumer empowerment and protection, on open access to the integrated market, on third-party access to transmission and distribution infrastructure, unbundling requirements, and rules on the independence of regulatory authorities in the member states.
this directive also sets out modes for member states, regulatory authorities and transmission system operators to cooperate towards the creation of a fully interconnected internal market for electricity that increases the integration of electricity from renewable sources, free competition and security of supply."""^^xsd:string .

2.   member states shall lay down the criteria for the grant of authorisations for the construction of generating capacity in their territory. in determining appropriate criteria, member states shall consider:
(a)
the safety and security of the electricity system, installations and associated equipment;
(b)
the protection of public health and safety;
(c)
the protection of the environment;
(d)
land use and siting;
(e)
the use of public ground;

the persons responsible for the management of the distribution system operator must not participate in company structures of the integrated electricity undertaking responsible, directly or indirectly, for the day-to-day operation of the generation, transmission or supply of electricity;
(b)
appropriate measures must be taken to ensure that the professional interests of the persons responsible for the management of the distribution system operator are taken into account in a manner that ensures that they are capable of acting independently;
(c)
the distribution system operator must have effective decision-making rights, independent from the integrated electricity undertaking, with respect to assets necessary to operate, maintain or develop the network. in order to fulfil those tasks, the distribution system operator shall have at its disposal the necessary resources including human, technical, physical and financial resources. this should not prevent the existence of appropriate coordination mechanisms to ensure that the economic and management supervision rights of the parent company in respect of return on assets, regulated indirectly in accordance with article 59(7), in a subsidiary are protected. in particular, this shall enable the parent company to approve the annual financial plan, or any equivalent instrument, of the distribution system operator and to set global limits on the levels of indebtedness of its subsidiary. it shall not permit the parent company to give instructions regarding day-to-day operations, nor with respect to individual decisions concerning the construction or upgrading of distribution lines, that do not exceed the terms of the approved financial plan, or any equivalent instrument; and
(d)
the distribution system operator must establish a compliance programme, which sets out measures taken to ensure that discriminatory conduct is excluded, and ensure that observance of it is adequately monitored. the compliance programme shall set out the specific obligations of employees to meet that objective. an annual report, setting out the measures taken, shall be submitted by the person or body responsible for monitoring the compliance programme, the compliance officer of the distribution system operator, to the regulatory authority referred to in article 57(1) and shall be published. the compliance officer of the distribution system operator shall be fully independent and shall have access to all the necessary information of the distribution system operator and any affiliated undertaking to fulfil its task.

(b)
ensuring adequate means to meet its obligations;
(c)
contributing to security of supply through adequate transmission capacity and system reliability;
(d)
managing electricity flows on the system, taking into account exchanges with other interconnected systems. to that end, the transmission system operator shall be responsible for ensuring a secure, reliable and efficient electricity system and, in that context, for ensuring the availability of all necessary ancillary services, including those provided by demand response and energy storage facilities, insofar as such availability is independent from any other transmission systems with which its system is interconnected;
(e)
providing to the operator of other systems with which its system is interconnected sufficient information to ensure the secure and efficient operation, coordinated development and interoperability of the interconnected system;
(f)
ensuring non-discrimination as between system users or classes of system users, particularly in favour of its related undertakings;
(g)
providing system users with the information they need for efficient access to the system;
(h)
collecting congestion rents and payments under the inter-transmission system operator compensation mechanism, in accordance with article 49 of regulation (eu) 2019/943, granting and managing third-party access and giving reasoned explanations when it denies such access, which shall be monitored by the regulatory authorities; in carrying out their tasks under this article transmission system operators shall primarily facilitate market integration;
(i)
procuring ancillary services to ensure operational security;
(j)

eco-innovation
1.   upon application by a supplier or a manufacturer, co2 savings achieved through the use of innovative technologies or a combination of innovative technologies (‘innovative technology packages’) shall be considered.
such technologies shall be taken into consideration only if the methodology used to assess them is capable of producing verifiable, repeatable and comparable results.
the total contribution of those technologies to reducing the average specific emissions of co2 of a manufacturer may be up to 7 g co2/km.
the commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with article 17 in order to amend this regulation by adjusting the cap referred to in the third subparagraph of this paragraph with effect from 2025 onwards to take into account technological developments while ensuring a balanced proportion of the level of that cap in relation to the average specific emissions of co2 of manufacturers.
2.   the commission shall adopt, by means of implementing acts, detailed provisions for a procedure to approve the innovative technologies or innovative technology packages referred to in paragraph 1 of this article. those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in article 16(2). those detailed provisions shall be based on the following criteria for innovative technologies:
(a)
the supplier or manufacturer must be accountable for the co2 savings achieved through the use of the innovative technologies;
(b)
the innovative technologies must make a verified contribution to co2 reduction;
(c)
the innovative technologies must not be covered by the standard test cycle co2 measurement;
(d)
the innovative technologies must not:
(i)
be covered by mandatory provisions due to complementary additional measures complying with the 10 g co2/km reduction referred to in article 1(3); or
(ii)
be mandatory under other provisions of union law.
with effect from 1 january 2025, the criterion referred to in point (d)(i) of the first subparagraph shall not apply with regard to efficiency improvements for air conditioning systems.
3.   a supplier or a manufacturer that applies for a measure to be approved as an innovative technology or innovative technology package shall submit a report, including a verification report undertaken by an independent and certified body, to the commission. in the event of a possible interaction of the measure with another innovative technology or innovative technology package already approved, that report shall mention that interaction and the verification report shall evaluate to what extent that interaction modifies the reduction achieved by each measure.

review and report
1.   the commission shall, in 2023, thoroughly review the effectiveness of this regulation and submit a report to the european parliament and to the council with the result of the review.
2.   in the report referred to in paragraph 1, the commission shall consider, inter alia, the real-world representativeness of the co2 emission and fuel or energy consumption values determined pursuant to regulation (ec) no 715/2007; the deployment on the union market of zero- and low-emission vehicles, in particular with respect to light commercial vehicles; the roll-out of recharging and refuelling infrastructure reported under directive 2014/94/eu of the european parliament and of the council (20), including their financing; the potential contribution of the use of synthetic and advanced alternative fuels produced with renewable energy to emissions reductions; the co2 emissions reduction actually observed at the existing fleet level; the functioning of the incentive mechanism for zero- and low-emission vehicles; the potential effects of the transitional measure set out in point 6.3 of part a of annex i; the impact of this regulation on consumers, particularly on those on low and medium incomes; as well as aspects to further facilitate an economically viable and socially fair transition towards clean, competitive and affordable mobility in the union.
the commission shall, in that report, also identify a clear pathway for further co2 emissions reductions for passenger cars and light commercial vehicles beyond 2030 in order to significantly contribute to achieving the long-term goal of the paris agreement.
3.   the report referred to in paragraph 2 shall, where appropriate, be accompanied by a proposal for amending this regulation, in particular, the possible revision of the eu fleet-wide targets for 2030 in light of the elements listed in paragraph 2, and the introduction of binding emissions reduction targets for 2035 and 2040 onwards for passenger cars and light commercial vehicles to ensure the timely transformation of the transport sector towards achieving net-zero emissions in line with the objectives of the paris agreement.
4.   as part of the review referred to in paragraph 1 of this article, the commission shall assess the feasibility of developing real-world emission test procedures using portable emission measurement systems (pems). the commission shall take into account that assessment as well as those made pursuant to article 12 of this regulation and may, where appropriate, review the procedures for measuring co2 emissions as set out under regulation (ec) no 715/2007. the commission shall, in particular, make appropriate proposals to adapt those procedures to reflect adequately the real-world co2 emissions of passenger cars and light commercial vehicles.
5.   as part of the review referred to in paragraph 1 of this article, the commission shall evaluate the possibility to assign the revenue from the excess emissions premiums to a specific fund or a relevant programme, with the objective to ensure a just transition towards a climate-neutral economy as referred to in article 4.1 of the paris agreement, in particular to support re-skilling, up-skilling and other skills training and reallocation of workers in the automotive sector in all affected member states, in particular in the regions and the communities most affected by the transition. the commission shall, if appropriate, make a legislative proposal to that effect by 2027 at the latest.
6.   by 31 december 2020, the commission shall review directive 1999/94/ec considering the need to provide consumers with accurate, robust and comparable information on the fuel consumption, co2 emissions and air pollutant emissions of new passenger cars placed on the market, as well as evaluate the options for introducing a fuel economy and co2 emissions label for new light commercial vehicles. the review shall, where appropriate, be accompanied by a legislative proposal.
7.   the commission shall, by means of implementing acts, determine the correlation parameters necessary in order to reflect any change in the regulatory test procedure for the measurement of specific emissions of co2 referred to in regulations (ec) no 715/2007 and (ec) no 692/2008 and, where applicable, regulation (eu) 2017/1151. those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in article 16(2) of this regulation.
8.   the commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with article 17 in order to amend this regulation by adapting the formulae set out in annex i, using the methodology adopted pursuant to paragraph 7 of this article, while ensuring that reduction requirements of comparable stringency for manufacturers and vehicles of different utility are required under the old and new test procedures."""^^xsd:string ;
