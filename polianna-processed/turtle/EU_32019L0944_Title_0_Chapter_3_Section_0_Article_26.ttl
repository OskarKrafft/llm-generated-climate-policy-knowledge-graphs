2.   where necessary, member states shall ensure that alternative dispute resolution entities cooperate to provide simple, fair, transparent, independent, effective and efficient out-of-court dispute settlement mechanisms for any dispute that arises from products or services that are tied to, or bundled with, any product or service falling under the scope of this directive.
3.   the participation of electricity undertakings in out-of-court dispute settlement mechanisms for household customers shall be mandatory unless the member state demonstrates to the commission that other mechanisms are equally effective."""^^xsd:string ;
