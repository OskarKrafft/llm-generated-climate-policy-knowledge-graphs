‘(35a)
directive 2010/31/eu of the european parliament and of the council of 19 may 2010 on the energy performance of buildings (29) requires member states to set energy performance requirements for building elements that form part of the building envelope and system requirements in respect of the overall energy performance, the proper installation, and the appropriate dimensioning, adjustment and control of the technical building systems which are installed in existing buildings. it is consistent with the objectives of this directive that these requirements may in certain circumstances limit the installation of energy-related products which comply with this directive and its implementing measures, provided that such requirements do not constitute an unjustifiable market barrier.

the following sentence is added to the end of article 6(1):
‘this shall be without prejudice to the energy performance requirements and system requirements set by member states in accordance with article 4(1) and article 8 of directive 2010/31/eu.’."""^^xsd:string ;
