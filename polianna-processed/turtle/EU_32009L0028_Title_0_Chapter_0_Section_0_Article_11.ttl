make a statistical transfer of specified amounts of energy from renewable sources from one member state to another member state in accordance with article 6; or
(b)
set up a distribution rule agreed by participating member states that allocates amounts of energy from renewable sources between the participating member states. such a rule shall be notified to the commission no later than three months after the end of the first year in which it takes effect.
2.   within three months of the end of each year each member state having made a notification under paragraph 1(b) shall issue a letter of notification stating the total amount of electricity or heating or cooling from renewable energy sources produced during the year which is to be the subject of the distribution rule.
