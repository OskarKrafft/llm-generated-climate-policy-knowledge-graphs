smart metering systems
1.   in order to promote energy efficiency and to empower final customers, member states or, where a member state has so provided, the regulatory authority shall strongly recommend that electricity undertakings and other market participants optimise the use of electricity, inter alia, by providing energy management services, developing innovative pricing formulas, and introducing smart metering systems that are interoperable, in particular with consumer energy management systems and with smart grids, in accordance with the applicable union data protection rules.
2.   member states shall ensure the deployment in their territories of smart metering systems that assist the active participation of customers in the electricity market. such deployment may be subject to a cost-benefit assessment which shall be undertaken in accordance with the principles laid down in annex ii.
3.   member states that proceed with the deployment of smart metering systems shall adopt and publish the minimum functional and technical requirements for the smart metering systems to be deployed in their territories, in accordance with article 20 and annex ii. member states shall ensure the interoperability of those smart metering systems, as well as their ability to provide output for consumer energy management systems. in that respect, member states shall have due regard to the use of the relevant available standards, including those enabling interoperability, to best practices and to the importance of the development of smart grids and the development of the internal market for electricity.
4.   member states that proceed with the deployment of smart metering systems shall ensure that final customers contribute to the associated costs of the deployment in a transparent and non-discriminatory manner, while taking into account the long-term benefits to the whole value chain. member states or, where a member state has so provided, the designated competent authorities, shall regularly monitor such deployment in their territories to track the delivery of benefits to consumers.
5.   where the deployment of smart metering systems has been negatively assessed as a result of the cost-benefit assessment referred to in paragraph 2, member states shall ensure that this assessment is revised at least every four years, or more frequently, in response to significant changes in the underlying assumptions and in response to technological and market developments. member states shall notify to the commission the outcome of their updated cost-benefit assessment as it becomes available.
6.   the provisions in this directive concerning smart metering systems shall apply to future installations and to installations that replace older smart meters. smart metering systems that have already been installed, or for which the ‘start of works’ began, before 4 july 2019, may remain in operation over their lifetime but, in the case of smart metering systems that do not meet the requirements of article 20 and annex ii, shall not remain in operation after 5 july 2031.
for the purpose of this paragraph, ‘start of works’ means either the start of construction works on the investment or the first firm commitment to order equipment or other commitment that makes the investment irreversible, whichever is the first in time. buying of land and preparatory works such as obtaining permits and conducting preliminary feasibility studies are not considered as start of works. for take-overs, ‘start of works’ means the moment of acquiring the assets directly linked to the acquired establishment."""^^xsd:string ;
