stability of financial support
1.   without prejudice to adaptations necessary to comply with articles 107 and 108 tfeu, member states shall ensure that the level of, and the conditions attached to, the support granted to renewable energy projects are not revised in a way that negatively affects the rights conferred thereunder and undermines the economic viability of projects that already benefit from support.
2.   member states may adjust the level of support in accordance with objective criteria, provided that such criteria are established in the original design of the support scheme.
3.   member states shall publish a long-term schedule anticipating the expected allocation of support, covering, as a reference, at least the following five years, or, in the case of budgetary planning constraints, the following three years, including the indicative timing, the frequency of tendering procedures where appropriate, the expected capacity and budget or maximum unitary support expected to be allocated, and the expected eligible technologies, if applicable. that schedule shall be updated on an annual basis or, where necessary, to reflect recent market developments or expected allocation of support.
4.   member states shall, at least every five years, assess the effectiveness of their support schemes for electricity from renewable sources and their major distributive effects on different consumer groups, and on investments. that assessment shall take into account the effect of possible changes to the support schemes. the indicative long-term planning governing the decisions of the support and design of new support shall take into account the results of that assessment. member states shall include the assessment in the relevant updates of their integrated national energy and climate plans and progress reports in accordance with regulation (eu) 2018/1999."""^^xsd:string ;
