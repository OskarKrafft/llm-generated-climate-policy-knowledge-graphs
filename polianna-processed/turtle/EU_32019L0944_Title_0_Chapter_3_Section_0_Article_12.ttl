right to switch and rules on switching-related fees
1.   switching supplier or market participant engaged in aggregation shall be carried out within the shortest possible time. member states shall ensure that a customer wishing to switch suppliers or market participants engaged in aggregation, while respecting contractual conditions, is entitled to such a switch within a maximum of three weeks from the date of the request. by no later than 2026, the technical process of switching supplier shall take no longer than 24 hours and shall be possible on any working day.
2.   member states shall ensure that at least household customers and small enterprises are not charged any switching-related fees.
3.   by way of derogation from paragraph 2, member states may permit suppliers or market participants engaged in aggregation to charge customers contract termination fees where those customers voluntarily terminate fixed-term, fixed-price electricity supply contracts before their maturity, provided that such fees are part of a contract that the customer has voluntarily entered into and that such fees are clearly communicated to the customer before the contract is entered into. such fees shall be proportionate and shall not exceed the direct economic loss to the supplier or the market participant engaged in aggregation resulting from the customer's termination of the contract, including the costs of any bundled investments or services that have already been provided to the customer as part of the contract. the burden of proving the direct economic loss shall be on the supplier or market participant engaged in aggregation, and the permissibility of contract termination fees shall be monitored by the regulatory authority, or by an other competent national authority.
4.   member states shall ensure that the right to switch supplier or market participants engaged in aggregation is granted to customers in a non-discriminatory manner as regards cost, effort and time.
5.   household customers shall be entitled to participate in collective switching schemes. member states shall remove all regulatory or administrative barriers for collective switching, while providing a framework that ensures the utmost consumer protection to avoid any abusive practices."""^^xsd:string ;
