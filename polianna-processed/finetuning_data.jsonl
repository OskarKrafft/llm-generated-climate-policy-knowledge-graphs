producers located in member states with which there is a direct connection via interconnectors. however, member states shall not change or otherwise affect cross-zonal schedules and capacity allocation due to producers participating in cross-border support schemes. cross-border electricity transfers shall be determined only by the outcome of capacity allocation pursuant to union law on the internal market in electricity.\n3.   if a member state decides to open participation in support schemes to producers located in other member states, the relevant member states shall agree on the principles of such participation. such agreements shall cover at least the principles of allocation of renewable electricity that is the subject of cross-border support.\n4.   the commission shall, upon the request of the relevant member states, assist them throughout the negotiation process with the setting up of cooperation arrangements by providing information and analysis, including quantitative and qualitative data on the direct and indirect costs and benefits of cooperation, as well as with guidance and technical expertise. the commission may encourage or facilitate the exchange of best practices and may develop templates for cooperation agreements in order to facilitate the negotiation process. the commission shall assess, by 2025, the costs and benefits of the deployment of electricity from renewable sources in the union pursuant to this article.\n5.   by 2023, the commission shall carry out an evaluation of the implementation of this article. that evaluation shall assess the need to introduce an obligation on member states partially to open participation in their support schemes for electricity from renewable sources to producers located in other member states with a view to a 5 % opening by 2025 and a 10 % opening by 2030.\"\"\"^^xsd:string ;\n    pol:grants_monitoring_authority <http://eurovoc.europa.eu/4038> ;\n

electricity, natural gas, district heating, district cooling and domestic hot water are provided with competitively priced individual meters that accurately reflect the final customer’s actual energy consumption and that provide information on actual time of use.\nsuch a competitively priced individual meter shall always be provided when:\n(a)\nan existing meter is replaced, unless this is technically impossible or not cost-effective in relation to the estimated potential savings in the long term;\n(b)\na new connection is made in a new building or a building undergoes major renovations, as set out in directive 2010/31/eu.\n2.   where, and to the extent that, member states implement intelligent metering systems and roll out smart meters for natural gas and/or electricity in accordance with directives 2009/72/ec and 2009/73/ec:\n(a)\nthey shall ensure that the metering systems provide to final customers information on actual time of use and that the objectives of energy efficiency and benefits for final customers are fully taken into account when establishing the minimum functionalities of the meters and the obligations imposed on market participants;\n(b)\nthey shall ensure the security of the smart meters and data communication, and the privacy of final customers, in compliance with relevant union data protection and privacy legislation;\n(c)\nin the case of electricity and at the request of the final customer, they shall require meter operators to ensure that the meter or meters can account for electricity put into the grid from the final customer’s premises;\n(d)\nthey shall ensure that if final customers request it, metering data on their electricity input and off-take is made available to them or to a third party acting on behalf of the final customer in an easily understandable format that they can use to compare deals on a like-for-like basis;\n(e)\nthey shall require that appropriate advice and information be given to customers at the time of installation of smart meters, in particular about their full potential with regard to meter reading management and the monitoring of energy consumption.\n3.   where heating and cooling or hot water are supplied to a building from a district heating network or from a central source servicing multiple buildings, a heat or hot water meter shall be installed at the heating exchanger or point of delivery.\nin multi-apartment and multi-purpose buildings with a central heating/cooling source or supplied from a district heating network or from a central source serving multiple buildings, individual consumption meters shall also be installed by 31 december 2016 to measure the consumption of heat or cooling or hot water for each unit where technically feasible and cost-efficient. where the use of individual meters is not technically feasible or not cost-efficient, to measure heating, individual heat cost allocators shall be used for measuring heat consumption at each radiator, unless it is shown by the member state in question that the installation of such heat cost allocators would not be cost-efficient. in those cases, alternative cost-efficient methods of heat consumption measurement may be considered.\nwhere multi-apartment buildings are supplied from district heating or cooling, or where own common heating or cooling systems for such buildings are prevalent, member states may introduce transparent rules on the allocation of the cost of thermal or hot water consumption in such buildings to ensure transparency and accuracy of accounting for individual consumption. where appropriate, such rules shall include guidelines on the way to allocate costs for heat and/or hot water that is used as

integrated national energy and climate plan — as regards the plans for the 2021-2030 period, in its final national energy and climate plan — at least the provisional results of such regional consultations, including, where applicable, how the comments of the member states or third countries consulted have been taken into account.\n3.   member states may engage in voluntary joint drafting of parts of their integrated national energy and climate plans and progress reports, including in regional cooperation fora. if they do so, the result shall replace the equivalent parts of their integrated national energy and climate plan and progress reports. upon a request by two or more member states, the commission shall facilitate that exercise.\n4.   in order to facilitate market integration and cost-efficient policies and measures, member states shall, in the period between the deadline for submission of their draft integrated national energy and climate plans and the deadline for submission of their final plans, present the relevant parts of their draft integrated national energy and climate plan in relevant regional cooperation fora with a view to their finalisation. where necessary, the commission shall facilitate such cooperation and consultation among the member states, and if it identifies opportunities for further regional cooperation, it may provide member states with indicative guidance in order to facilitate the effective cooperation and consultation process.\n5.   member states shall consider the comments received from other member states pursuant to paragraphs 2 and 3 in their final integrated national energy and climate plan, and explain in those plans how such comments have been considered.\n6.   for the purposes referred to in paragraph 1, member states shall continue to cooperate at regional level, and, as appropriate, in regional cooperation fora, when implementing the relevant policies and measures of their integrated national energy and climate plans.\n7.   member states may also envisage cooperation with signatories to the energy community and with third-country members of the european economic area.\n8.   in so far as the provisions of directive 2001/42/ec are applicable, transboundary consultation undertaken on the draft in accordance with article 7 of that directive shall be deemed to satisfy the obligations on regional cooperation pursuant to this regulation, provided that the requirements of this article are complied with.\"\"\"^^xsd:string ;\n    pol:specifies_compliance_time

in the transport sector and bioliquids, and the physical production of heating and cooling and electricity from biomass fuels has started.\nthe greenhouse gas emission savings from the use of biofuels, biogas consumed in the transport sector, bioliquids and biomass fuels used in installations producing heating, cooling and electricity shall be calculated in accordance with article 31(1).\n11.   electricity from biomass fuels shall be taken into account for the purposes referred to in points (a), (b) and (c) of the first subparagraph of paragraph 1 only if it meets one or more of the following requirements:\n(a)\nit is produced in installations with a total rated thermal input below 50 mw;\n(b)\nfor installations with a total rated thermal input from 50 to 100 mw, it is produced applying high-efficiency cogeneration technology, or, for electricity-only installations, meeting an energy efficiency level associated with the best available techniques (bat-aeels) as defined in commission implementing decision (eu) 2017/1442 (26);\n(c)\nfor installations with a total rated thermal input above 100 mw, it is produced applying high-efficiency cogeneration technology, or, for electricity-only installations, achieving an net-electrical efficiency of at least 36 %;\n(d)\nit is produced applying biomass co2 capture and storage.\nfor the purposes of points (a), (b) and (c) of the first subparagraph of paragraph 1 of this article, electricity-only-installations shall be taken into account only if they do not use fossil fuels as a main fuel and only if there is no cost-effective potential for the application of high-efficiency cogeneration technology according to the assessment in accordance with article 14 of directive 2012/27/eu.\nfor the purposes of points (a) and (b) of the first subparagraph of paragraph 1 of this article, this paragraph shall apply only to installations starting operation or converted to the use of biomass fuels after 25 december 2021. for the purposes of point (c) of the first subparagraph of paragraph 1 of this article, this paragraph shall be without prejudice to support granted under support schemes in accordance with article 4 approved by 25 december 2021.\nmember states may apply higher energy efficiency requirements than those referred in the first subparagraph to installations with lower rated thermal input.\nthe first subparagraph shall not apply to electricity from installations which are the object of a specific notification by a member state to the commission based on the duly substantiated existence of risks for the security of supply of electricity. upon assessment of the notification, the commission shall adopt a decision taking into account the elements included therein.\n12.   for the purposes referred to in points (a), (b) and (c) of the first subparagraph of paragraph 1 of this article, and without prejudice to articles 25 and 26, member states shall not refuse to take into account, on other sustainability grounds, biofuels and bioliquids obtained in compliance with this article. this paragraph shall be without prejudice to public support granted under support schemes approved before 24 december 2018.\n13.   for the purposes referred to in point (c) of the first subparagraph of paragraph 1 of this article, member states may derogate, for a limited period of time, from the criteria laid down in paragraphs 2 to 7 and 10 and 11 of this article by adopting different criteria for:\n(a)\ninstallations located in an outermost region as referred to in article 349 tfeu to the extent that such facilities produce electricity or heating or cooling from biomass fuels; and\n(b)\nbiomass fuels used in the installations referred to in point (a) of this subparagraph, irrespective of the place of origin of that biomass, provided that such criteria are objectively justified on the grounds that their aim is to ensure, for that outermost region, a smooth phase-in of the criteria laid down in paragraphs 2 to 7 and 10 and 11 of this article and thereby incentivise the transition from fossil fuels to sustainable biomass fuels.\nthe different criteria referred to in this paragraph shall be subject to a specific notification by the relevant member state to the commission.\n14.   for the purposes referred to in points (a), (b) and (c) of the first subparagraph of paragraph 1, member states may establish additional sustainability criteria for biomass fuels.\nby 31 december 2026, the commission shall assess the impact of such additional criteria on the internal market, accompanied, if necessary, by a proposal to ensure harmonisation thereof.\"\"\"^^xsd:string ;\n    pol:grants_legislative_authority <http://eurovoc.europa.eu/4038> ;\n

result, in view of:\n(a)\nthe long-term potential of a particular technology;\n(b)\nthe need to achieve diversification;\n(c)\ngrid integration costs;\n(d)\nnetwork constraints and grid stability;\n(e)\nfor biomass, the need to avoid distortions of raw materials markets.\n6.   where support for electricity from renewable sources is granted by means of a tendering procedure, member states shall, in order to ensure a high project realisation rate:\n(a)\nestablish and publish non-discriminatory and transparent criteria to qualify for the tendering procedure and set clear dates and rules for delivery of the project;\n(b)\npublish information about previous tendering procedures, including project realisation rates.\n7.   in order to increase the generation of energy from renewable sources in the outermost regions and small islands, member states may adapt financial support schemes for projects located in those regions in order to take into account the production costs associated with their specific conditions of isolation and external dependence.\n8.   by 31 december 2021 and every three years thereafter, the commission shall report to the european parliament and to the council on the performance of support for electricity from renewable sources granted by means of tendering procedures in the union, analysing in particular the ability of tendering

between member states and between member states and third countries. member states shall also take appropriate steps to accelerate authorisation procedures for grid infrastructure and to coordinate approval of grid infrastructure with administrative and planning procedures.\n2.   subject to requirements relating to the maintenance of the reliability and safety of the grid, based on transparent and non-discriminatory criteria defined by the competent national authorities:\n(a)\nmember states shall ensure that transmission system operators and distribution system operators in their territory guarantee the transmission and distribution of electricity produced from renewable energy sources;\n(b)\nmember states shall also provide for either priority access or guaranteed access to the grid-system of electricity produced from renewable energy sources;\n(c)\nmember states shall ensure that when dispatching electricity generating installations, transmission system operators shall give priority to generating installations using renewable energy sources in so far as the secure operation of the national electricity system permits and based on transparent and non-discriminatory criteria. member states shall ensure that appropriate grid and market-related operational measures are taken in order to minimise the curtailment of electricity produced from renewable energy sources. if significant measures are taken to curtail the renewable energy sources in order to guarantee the security of the national electricity system and security of energy supply, members states shall ensure that the responsible system operators report to the competent regulatory authority on those measures and indicate which corrective measures they intend to take in order to prevent inappropriate curtailments.\n3.   member states shall require transmission system operators and distribution system operators to set up and make public their standard rules relating to the bearing and sharing of costs of technical adaptations, such as grid connections and grid reinforcements, improved operation of the grid and rules on the non-discriminatory implementation of the grid codes, which are necessary in order to integrate new producers feeding electricity produced from renewable energy sources into the interconnected grid.\nthose rules shall be based on objective, transparent and non-discriminatory criteria taking particular account of all the costs and benefits associated with the connection of those producers to the grid and of the particular circumstances of producers located in peripheral regions and in regions of low population density. those rules may provide for different types of connection.\n4.   where appropriate, member states may require transmission system operators and distribution system operators to bear, in full or in part, the costs referred to in paragraph 3. member states shall review and take the necessary measures to improve the frameworks and rules for the bearing and sharing of costs referred to in paragraph 3 by 30 june 2011 and every two years thereafter to ensure the integration of new producers as referred to in that paragraph.\n5.   member states shall require transmission system operators and distribution system operators to provide any new producer of energy from renewable sources wishing to be connected to the system with the comprehensive and necessary information required, including:\n(a)\na comprehensive and detailed estimate of the costs associated with the connection;\n(b)\na reasonable and precise timetable for receiving and processing the request for grid connection;\n(c)\na reasonable indicative timetable for any proposed grid connection.\nmember states may allow producers of electricity from renewable energy sources wishing to be connected to the grid to issue a call for tender for the connection work.\n6.   the sharing of costs referred in paragraph 3 shall be enforced by a mechanism

distribution system operators derive from the connections.\n7.   member states shall ensure that the charging of transmission and distribution tariffs does not discriminate against electricity from renewable energy sources, including in particular electricity from renewable energy sources produced in peripheral regions, such as island regions, and in regions of low population density. member states shall ensure that the charging of transmission and distribution tariffs does not discriminate against gas from renewable energy sources.\n8.   member states shall ensure that tariffs charged by transmission system operators and distribution system operators for the transmission and distribution of electricity from plants using renewable energy sources reflect realisable cost benefits resulting from the plant’s connection to the network. such cost benefits could arise from the direct use of the low-voltage grid.\n9.   where relevant, member states shall assess the need to extend existing gas network infrastructure to facilitate the integration of gas from renewable energy sources.\n10.   where relevant, member states shall require transmission system operators and distribution system operators in their territory to publish technical rules in line with article 6 of directive 2003/55/ec of the european parliament and of the council of 26 june 2003 concerning the common rules for the internal market in natural gas (21), in particular regarding network connection rules that include gas quality, gas odoration and gas pressure requirements. member states shall

deviate from those provisional tariffs or methodologies.\n2.   any party having a complaint against a transmission or distribution system operator in relation to that operator's obligations under this directive may refer the complaint to the regulatory authority which, acting as dispute settlement authority, shall issue a decision within two months of receipt of the complaint. that period may be extended by two months where additional information is sought by the regulatory authority. that extended period may be further extended with the agreement of the complainant. the regulatory authority's decision shall have binding effect unless and until overruled on appeal.\n3.   any party who is affected and who has a right to complain concerning a decision on methodologies taken pursuant to article 59 or, where the regulatory authority has a duty to consult, concerning the proposed tariffs or methodologies, may, within two months, or within a shorter period as provided for by member states, after publication of the decision or proposal for a decision, submit a complaint for review. such a complaint shall not have suspensive effect.\n4.   member states shall create appropriate and efficient mechanisms for regulation, control and transparency so as to avoid any abuse of a dominant position, in particular to the detriment of consumers, and any predatory behaviour. those mechanisms shall take account of the provisions of the tfeu, and in particular article 102 thereof.\n5.   member states shall ensure that the appropriate measures are taken, including administrative action or criminal proceedings in conformity with their national law, against the natural or legal persons responsible where confidentiality rules imposed by this directive have not been respected.\n6.   complaints referred to in paragraphs 2 and 3 shall be without prejudice to the exercise of rights of appeal under union or national law.\n7.   decisions taken by regulatory authorities shall be fully reasoned and justified to allow for judicial review. the decisions shall be available to the public while preserving the confidentiality of commercially sensitive information.\n8.   member states shall ensure that suitable mechanisms exist at national level under which a party affected by a decision of a regulatory authority has a right of appeal to a body independent of the parties involved and of any government.\"\"\"^^xsd:string ;\n    pol:specifies_compliance_time pol:EU_32019L0944_Title_0_Chapter_7_Section_5_Article_60_TimeCompliance_1

associated transmission and distribution networks for the production of electricity, heating or cooling from renewable sources, to the process of transformation of biomass into biofuels, bioliquids, biomass fuels or other energy products, and to renewable liquid and gaseous transport fuels of non-biological origin are proportionate and necessary and contribute to the implementation of the energy efficiency first principle.\nmember states shall, in particular, take the appropriate steps to ensure that:\n(a)\nadministrative procedures are streamlined and expedited at the appropriate administrative level and predictable timeframes are established for the procedures referred to in the first subparagraph;\n(b)\nrules concerning authorisation, certification and licensing are objective, transparent and proportionate, do not discriminate between applicants and take fully into account the particularities of individual renewable energy technologies;\n(c)\nadministrative charges paid by consumers, planners, architects, builders and equipment and system installers and suppliers are transparent and cost-related; and\n(d)\nsimplified and less burdensome authorisation procedures, including a simple-notification procedure, are established for decentralised devices, and for producing and storing energy from renewable sources.\n2.   member states shall clearly define any technical specifications which are to be met by renewable energy equipment and systems in order to benefit from support schemes. where european standards exist, including eco-labels, energy labels and other technical reference systems established by the european standardisation bodies, such technical specifications shall be expressed in terms of those standards. such technical specifications shall not prescribe where the equipment and systems are to be certified and shall not impede the proper functioning of the internal market.\n3.   member states shall ensure that their competent authorities at national, regional and local level include provisions for the integration and deployment of renewable energy, including for renewables self-consumption and renewable energy communities, and the use of unavoidable waste heat and cold when planning, including early spatial planning, designing, building and renovating urban infrastructure, industrial, commercial or residential areas and energy infrastructure, including electricity, district heating and cooling, natural gas and alternative fuel networks. member states shall, in particular, encourage local and regional administrative bodies to include heating and cooling from renewable sources in the planning of city infrastructure where appropriate, and to consult the network operators to reflect the impact of energy efficiency and demand response programs as well as specific provisions on renewables self-consumption and renewable energy communities, on the infrastructure development plans of the operators.\n4.   member states shall introduce appropriate measures in their building regulations and codes in order to increase the share of all kinds of energy from renewable sources in the building sector.\nin establishing such measures or in their support schemes, member states may take into account, where applicable, national measures relating to substantial increases in renewables self-consumption, in local energy storage and in energy efficiency, relating to cogeneration and relating to passive, low-energy or zero-energy buildings.\nmember states shall, in their building regulations and codes or by other means with equivalent effect, require the use of minimum levels of energy from renewable sources in new buildings and in existing buildings that are subject to major renovation in so far as technically, functionally and economically feasible, and reflecting the results of the cost-optimal calculation carried out pursuant to article 5(2) of directive 2010/31/eu, and in so far as this does not negatively affect indoor air quality. member states shall permit those minimum levels to be fulfilled, inter alia, through efficient district heating and cooling using a significant share of renewable energy and waste heat and cold.\nthe requirements laid down in the first subparagraph shall apply to the armed forces only to the extent that its application does not cause any conflict with the nature and primary aim of the activities of the armed forces and with the exception of material used exclusively for military purposes.\n5.   member states shall ensure that new public buildings, and existing public buildings that are subject to major renovation, at national, regional and local level, fulfil an exemplary role in the context of this directive from 1 january 2012. member states may, inter alia, allow that obligation to be fulfilled by complying with nearly zero-energy building provisions as required in directive 2010/31/eu, or by providing for the roofs of public or mixed private-public buildings to be used by third parties for installations that produce energy from renewable sources.\n6.   with respect to their building regulations and codes, member states shall promote the use of renewable heating and cooling systems and equipment that achieve a significant reduction of energy consumption. to that end, member states shall use energy or eco-labels or other appropriate certificates or standards developed at national or union level, where these exist, and ensure the provision of adequate information and advice on renewable, highly energy efficient alternatives as well as eventual financial instruments and incentives available in the case of replacement, with a view to promoting an increased replacement rate of old heating systems and an increased switch to solutions based on renewable energy in accordance with directive 2010/31/eu.\n7.   member states shall carry out an assessment of their potential of energy from renewable sources and of the use of waste heat and cold in the heating and cooling sector. that assessment shall, where appropriate, include spatial analysis of areas suitable for low-ecological-risk deployment and the potential for small-scale household projects and shall be included in the second comprehensive assessment required pursuant to article 14(1) of directive 2012/27/eu for the first time by 31 december 2020 and in the subsequent updates of the comprehensive assessments.\n8.   member states shall assess the regulatory and administrative barriers to long-term renewables power purchase agreements, and shall remove unjustified barriers to, and facilitate the uptake of, such agreements. member states shall ensure that those agreements are not subject to disproportionate or discriminatory procedures or charges.\nmember states shall describe policies and measures facilitating the uptake of renewables power purchase agreements in their

shall ensure that any national rules concerning the authorisation, certification and licensing procedures that are applied to plants and associated transmission and distribution networks for the production of electricity, heating or cooling from renewable sources, to the process of transformation of biomass into biofuels, bioliquids, biomass fuels or other energy products, and to renewable liquid and gaseous transport fuels of non-biological origin are proportionate and necessary and contribute to the implementation of the energy efficiency first principle.\nmember states shall, in particular, take the appropriate steps to ensure that:\n(a)\nadministrative procedures are streamlined and expedited at the appropriate administrative level and predictable timeframes are established for the procedures referred to in the first subparagraph;\n(b)\nrules concerning authorisation, certification and licensing are objective, transparent and proportionate, do not discriminate between applicants and take fully into account the particularities of individual renewable energy technologies;\n(c)\nadministrative charges paid by consumers, planners, architects, builders and equipment and system installers and suppliers are transparent and cost-related; and\n(d)\nsimplified and less burdensome authorisation procedures, including a simple-notification procedure, are established for decentralised devices, and for producing and storing energy from renewable sources.\n2.   member states shall clearly define any technical specifications which are to be met by renewable energy equipment and systems in order to benefit from support schemes. where european standards exist, including eco-labels, energy labels and other technical reference systems established by the european standardisation bodies, such technical specifications shall be expressed in terms of those standards. such technical specifications shall not prescribe where the equipment and systems are to be certified and shall not impede the proper functioning of the internal market.\n3.   member states shall ensure that their competent authorities at national, regional and local level include provisions for the integration and deployment of renewable energy, including for renewables self-consumption and renewable energy communities, and the use of unavoidable waste heat and cold when planning, including early spatial planning, designing, building and renovating urban infrastructure, industrial, commercial or residential areas and energy infrastructure, including electricity, district heating and cooling, natural gas and alternative fuel networks. member states shall, in particular, encourage local and regional administrative bodies to include heating and cooling from renewable sources in the planning of city infrastructure where appropriate, and to consult the network operators to reflect the impact of energy efficiency and demand response programs as well as specific provisions on renewables self-consumption and renewable energy communities, on the infrastructure development plans of the operators.\n4.   member states shall introduce appropriate measures in their building regulations and codes in order to increase the share of all kinds of energy from renewable sources in the building sector.\nin establishing such measures or in their support schemes, member states may take into account, where applicable, national measures relating to substantial increases in renewables self-consumption, in local energy storage and in energy efficiency, relating to cogeneration and relating to passive, low-energy or zero-energy buildings.\nmember states shall, in their building regulations and codes or by other means with equivalent effect, require the use of minimum levels of energy from renewable sources in new buildings and in existing buildings that are subject to major renovation in so far as technically, functionally and economically feasible, and reflecting the results of the cost-optimal calculation carried out pursuant to article 5(2) of directive 2010/31/eu, and in so far as this does not negatively affect indoor air quality. member states shall permit those minimum levels to be fulfilled, inter alia, through efficient district heating and cooling using a significant share of renewable energy and waste heat and cold.\nthe requirements laid down in the first subparagraph shall apply to the armed forces only to the extent that its application does not cause any conflict with the nature and primary aim of the activities of the armed forces and with the exception of material used exclusively for military purposes.\n5.   member states shall ensure that new public buildings, and existing public buildings that are subject to major renovation, at national, regional and local level, fulfil an exemplary role in the context of this directive from 1 january 2012. member states may, inter alia, allow that obligation to be fulfilled by complying with nearly zero-energy building provisions as required in directive 2010/31/eu, or by providing for the roofs of public or mixed private-public buildings to be used by third parties for installations that produce energy from renewable sources.\n6.   with respect to their building regulations and codes, member states shall promote the use of renewable heating and cooling systems and equipment that achieve a significant reduction of energy consumption. to that end, member states shall use energy or eco-labels or other appropriate certificates or standards developed at national or union level, where these exist, and ensure the provision of adequate information and advice on renewable, highly energy efficient alternatives as well as eventual financial instruments and incentives available in the case of replacement, with a view to promoting an increased replacement rate of old heating systems and an increased switch to solutions based on renewable energy in accordance with directive 2010/31/eu.\n7.   member states shall carry out an assessment of their potential of energy from renewable sources and of the use of waste heat and cold in the heating and cooling sector. that assessment shall, where appropriate, include spatial analysis of areas suitable for low-ecological-risk deployment and the potential for small-scale household projects and shall be included in the second comprehensive assessment required pursuant to article 14(1) of directive 2012/27/eu for the first time by 31 december 2020 and in the subsequent updates of the comprehensive assessments.\n8.   member states shall assess the regulatory and administrative barriers to long-term renewables power purchase agreements, and shall remove unjustified barriers to, and facilitate the uptake of, such agreements. member states shall ensure that those agreements are not subject to disproportionate or discriminatory procedures or charges.\nmember states shall describe policies and measures facilitating the uptake of renewables power purchase agreements in their integrated national energy and climate plans and progress reports pursuant to regulation (eu)

consistent with a target of at least a 20 % share of energy from renewable sources in the community’s gross final consumption of energy in 2020. in order to achieve the targets laid down in this article more easily, each member state shall promote and encourage energy efficiency and energy saving.\n2.   member states shall introduce measures effectively designed to ensure that the share of energy from renewable sources equals or exceeds that shown in the indicative trajectory set out in part b of annex i.\n3.   in order to reach the targets set in paragraphs 1 and 2 of this article member states may, inter alia, apply the following measures:\n(a)\nsupport schemes;\n(b)\nmeasures of cooperation between different member states and with third countries for achieving their national overall targets in accordance with articles 5 to 11.\nwithout prejudice to articles 87 and 88 of the treaty, member states shall have the right to decide, in accordance with articles 5 to 11 of this directive, to which extent they support energy from renewable sources which is produced in a different member state.\n4.   each member state shall ensure that the share of energy from renewable sources in all forms of transport in 2020 is at least 10 % of the final consumption of energy in transport in that member state.\nfor the purposes of this paragraph, the following provisions shall apply:\n(a)\nfor the calculation of the denominator, that is the total amount of energy consumed in transport for the purposes of the first subparagraph, only petrol, diesel, biofuels consumed in road and rail transport, and electricity shall be taken into account;\n(b)\nfor the calculation of the numerator, that is the amount of energy from renewable sources consumed in transport for the purposes of the first subparagraph, all types of energy from renewable sources consumed in all forms of transport shall be taken into account;\n(c)\nfor the calculation of the contribution from electricity produced from renewable sources and consumed in all types of electric vehicles for the purpose of points (a) and (b), member states may choose to use either the average share of electricity from renewable energy sources in the community or the share of electricity from renewable energy sources in their own country as measured two years before the year in question. furthermore, for the calculation of the electricity from renewable energy sources consumed by electric road vehicles, that consumption shall be considered to be 2,5 times the energy content of the input of electricity from renewable energy sources.\nby 31 december 2011, the commission shall present, if appropriate, a proposal permitting, subject to certain conditions, the whole amount of the electricity originating from renewable sources used to power all types of electric vehicles to be considered.\nby 31 december 2011, the commission shall also present, if appropriate, a proposal for a methodology for calculating the contribution of hydrogen originating from renewable sources in the total fuel mix.\"\"\"^^xsd:string ;\n    pol:specifies_compliance_time

compliance with the sustainability and greenhouse gas emissions saving criteria\n1.   where biofuels, bioliquids and biomass fuels, or other fuels that are eligible for counting towards the numerator referred to in point (b) of article 27(1), are to be taken into account for the purposes referred to in articles 23 and 25 and in points (a), (b) and (c) of the first subparagraph of article 29(1), member states shall require economic operators to show that the sustainability and greenhouse gas emissions saving criteria laid down in article 29(2) to (7) and (10) have been fulfilled. for those purposes, they shall require economic operators to use a mass balance system which:\n(a)\nallows consignments of raw material or fuels with differing sustainability and greenhouse gas emissions saving characteristics to be mixed for instance in a container, processing or logistical facility, transmission and distribution infrastructure or site;\n(b)\nallows consignments of raw material with differing energy content to be mixed for the purposes of further processing, provided that the size of consignments is adjusted according to their energy content;\n(c)\nrequires information about the sustainability and greenhouse gas emissions saving characteristics and sizes of the consignments referred to in point (a) to remain assigned to the mixture; and\n(d)\nprovides for the sum of all consignments withdrawn from the mixture to be described as having the same sustainability characteristics, in the same quantities, as the sum of all consignments added to the mixture and requires that this balance be achieved over an appropriate period of time.\nthe mass balance system shall ensure that each consignment is counted only once in point (a), (b) or (c) of the first subparagraph of article 7(1) for the purposes of calculating the gross final consumption of energy from renewable sources and shall include information on whether support has been provided for the production of that consignment, and if so, on the type of support scheme.\n2.   where a consignment is processed, information on the sustainability and greenhouse gas emissions saving characteristics of the consignment shall be adjusted and assigned to the output in accordance with the following rules:\n(a)\nwhen the processing of a consignment of raw material yields only one output that is intended for the production of biofuels, bioliquids or biomass fuels, renewable liquid and gaseous transport fuels of non-biological origin, or recycled carbon fuels, the size of the consignment and the related quantities of sustainability and greenhouse gas emissions saving characteristics shall be adjusted applying a conversion factor representing the ratio between the mass of the output that is intended for such production and the mass of the raw material entering the process;\n(b)\nwhen the processing of a consignment of raw material yields more than one output that is intended for the production of biofuels, bioliquids or biomass fuels, renewable liquid and gaseous transport fuels of non-biological origin, or recycled carbon fuels, for each output a separate conversion factor shall be applied and a separate mass balance shall be used.\n3.   member states shall take measures to ensure that economic operators submit reliable information regarding the compliance with the greenhouse gas emissions savings thresholds set in, and adopted pursuant to, article 25(2), and with the sustainability and greenhouse gas emissions saving criteria laid down in article 29(2) to (7) and (10), and that economic operators make available to the relevant member state, upon request, the data that were used to develop the information. member states shall require economic operators to arrange for an adequate standard of independent auditing of the information submitted, and to provide evidence that this has been done. in order to comply with point (a) of article 29(6) and point (a) of article 29(7), the first or second party auditing may be used up to the first gathering point of the forest biomass. the auditing shall verify that the systems used by economic operators are accurate, reliable and protected against fraud, including verification ensuring that materials are not intentionally modified or discarded so that the consignment or part thereof could become a waste or residue. it shall evaluate the frequency and methodology of sampling and the robustness of the data.\nthe obligations laid down in this paragraph shall apply regardless of whether the biofuels, bioliquids, biomass fuels, renewable liquid and gaseous transport fuels of non-biological origin, or recycled carbon fuels are produced within the union or are imported. information about the geographic origin and feedstock type of biofuels, bioliquids and biomass fuels per fuel supplier shall be made available to consumers on the websites of operators, suppliers or the relevant competent authorities and shall be updated on an annual basis.\nmember states shall submit to the commission, in aggregated form, the information referred to in the first subparagraph of this paragraph. the commission shall publish that information on the e-reporting platform referred to in article 28 of regulation (eu) 2018/1999 in summary form preserving the confidentiality of commercially sensitive information.\n4.   the commission may decide that voluntary national or international schemes setting standards for the production of biofuels, bioliquids or biomass fuels, or other fuels that are eligible for counting towards the numerator referred to in point (b) of article 27(1), provide accurate data on greenhouse gas emission savings for the purposes of article 25(2) and article 29(10), demonstrate compliance with article 27(3) and article 28(2) and (4), or demonstrate that consignments of biofuels, bioliquids or biomass fuels comply with the sustainability criteria laid down in article 29(2) to (7). when demonstrating that the criteria laid down in article 29(6) and (7) are met, the operators may provide the required evidence directly at sourcing area level. the commission may recognise areas for the protection of rare, threatened or endangered ecosystems or species recognised by international agreements or included in lists drawn up by intergovernmental organisations or the international union for the conservation of nature for the purposes of point (c)(ii) of the first subparagraph of article 29(3).\nthe commission may decide that those schemes contain accurate information on measures taken for soil, water and air protection, for the restoration of degraded land, for the avoidance of excessive water consumption in areas where water is scarce, and for certification of biofuels, bioliquids and biomass fuels with low indirect land-use change-risk.\n5.   the commission shall adopt decisions under paragraph 4 of this article by means of implementing acts. those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in article 34(3). such decisions shall be valid for a period of no more than five years.\nthe commission shall require that each voluntary scheme on which a decision has been adopted under paragraph 4 submit annually by 30 april a report to the commission covering each of the points set out in annex ix to regulation (eu) 2018/1999. the report shall cover the preceding calendar year. the requirement to submit a report shall apply only to voluntary schemes that have operated for at least 12 months.\nthe commission shall make the reports drawn up by the voluntary schemes available, in an aggregated form or in full if appropriate, on the e-reporting platform referred to in article 28 of regulation (eu) 2018/1999.\n6.   member states may set up national schemes where compliance with the sustainability and greenhouse gas emissions saving criteria laid down in article 29(2) to (7) and (10) and with the greenhouse gas emissions savings thresholds for renewable liquid and gaseous transport fuels of non-biological origin and recycled carbon fuels set in, and adopted pursuant to, article 25(2) and in accordance with article 28(5) is verified throughout the entire chain of custody involving competent national authorities.\na member state may notify such a national scheme to the commission. the commission shall give priority to the assessment of such a scheme in order to facilitate mutual bilateral and multilateral recognition of schemes for verification of compliance with the sustainability and greenhouse gas emissions saving criteria for biofuels, bioliquids and biomass fuels and with the greenhouse gas emissions savings thresholds for other fuels that are eligible for counting towards the numerator referred to in point (b) of article 27(1). the commission may decide, by means of implementing acts, whether such a notified national scheme complies with the conditions laid down in this directive. those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in article 34(3).\nwhere the decision is positive, schemes established in accordance with this article shall not refuse mutual recognition with that member state's scheme, as regards verification of compliance with the sustainability and greenhouse gas emissions saving criteria laid down in article 29(2) to (7) and (10) and the greenhouse gas emissions savings thresholds set in, and adopted pursuant to, article 25(2).\n7.   the commission shall adopt decisions under paragraph 4 of this article only if the scheme in question meets adequate standards of reliability, transparency and independent auditing and provides adequate assurances that no materials have been intentionally modified or discarded so that the consignment or part thereof would fall under annex ix. in the case of schemes to measure greenhouse gas emissions savings, such schemes shall also comply with the methodological requirements set out in annex v or vi. lists of areas of high biodiversity value as referred to in point (c)(ii) of the first subparagraph of article 29(3) shall meet adequate standards of objectivity and coherence with internationally recognised standards and provide for appropriate appeal procedures.\nthe voluntary schemes referred to in paragraph 4 shall, at least annually, publish a list of their certification bodies used for independent auditing, indicating for each certification body by which entity or national public authority it was recognised and which entity or national public authority is monitoring it.\n8.   in order to ensure that compliance with the sustainability and greenhouse gas emissions saving criteria as well as with the provisions on low or high direct and indirect land-use change-risk biofuels, bioliquids and biomass fuels is verified in an efficient and harmonised manner and in particular to prevent fraud, the commission shall adopt implementing acts specifying detailed implementing rules, including adequate standards of reliability, transparency and independent auditing and require all voluntary schemes to apply those standards. those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in article 34(3).\nin those implementing acts, the commission shall pay particular attention to the need to minimise administrative burden. the implementing acts shall set a time frame by which voluntary schemes are required to implement the standards. the commission may repeal decisions recognising voluntary schemes pursuant to paragraph 4 in the event that those schemes fail to implement such standards in the time frame provided for. where a member state raises concerns that a voluntary scheme does not operate in accordance with the standards of reliability, transparency and independent auditing that constitute the basis for decisions under paragraph 4, the commission shall investigate the matter and take appropriate action.\n9.   where an economic operator provides evidence or data obtained in accordance with a scheme that has been the subject of a decision pursuant to paragraph 4 or 6 of this article, to the extent covered by that decision, a member state shall not require the supplier to provide further evidence of compliance with the sustainability and greenhouse gas emissions saving criteria laid down in article 29(2) to (7) and (10).\ncompetent authorities of the member states shall supervise the operation of certification bodies that are conducting independent auditing under a voluntary scheme. certification bodies shall submit, upon the request of competent authorities, all relevant information necessary to supervise the operation, including the exact date, time and location of audits. where member states find issues of non-conformity, they shall inform the voluntary scheme without delay.\n10.   at the request of a member state, which may be based on the request of an economic operator, the commission shall, on the basis of all available evidence, examine whether the sustainability and greenhouse gas emissions saving criteria laid down in article 29(2) to (7) and (10) in relation to a source of biofuels, bioliquids and biomass fuels, and the greenhouse gas emissions savings thresholds set in, and adopted pursuant to, article 25(2), have been met.\nwithin six months of receipt of such a request and in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in article 34(3), the commission shall, by means of implementing acts, decide whether the member state concerned may either:\n(a)\ntake into account biofuels, bioliquids, biomass fuels and other fuels that are eligible for counting towards the numerator referred to in point (b) of article 27(1) from that source for the purposes referred to in points (a), (b) and (c) of the first subparagraph of article 29(1); or\n(b)\nby way of derogation from paragraph 9 of this article, require suppliers of the source of biofuels, bioliquids, biomass fuels and other fuels that are eligible for counting towards the numerator referred to in point (b) of article 27(1) to provide further evidence of compliance with those sustainability and greenhouse gas emissions saving criteria and those greenhouse gas emissions savings thresholds.\n\n**Task**:

can be guaranteed as such within the meaning of this directive, in accordance with objective, transparent and non-discriminatory criteria.\n2.   to that end, member states shall ensure that a guarantee of origin is issued in response to a request from a producer of energy from renewable sources, unless member states decide, for the purposes of accounting for the market value of the guarantee of origin, not to issue such a guarantee of origin to a producer that receives financial support from a support scheme. member states may arrange for guarantees of origin to be issued for energy from non-renewable sources. issuance of guarantees of origin may be made subject to a minimum capacity limit. a guarantee of origin shall be of the standard size of 1 mwh. no more than one guarantee of origin shall be issued in respect of each unit of energy produced.\nmember states shall ensure that the same unit of energy from renewable sources is taken into account only once.\nmember states shall ensure that when a producer receives financial support from a support scheme, the market value of the guarantee of origin for the same production is taken into account appropriately in the relevant support scheme.\nit shall be presumed that the market value of the guarantee of origin has been taken into account appropriately in any of the following cases:\n(a)\nwhere the financial support is granted by way of a tendering procedure or a tradable green certificate system;\n(b)\nwhere the market value of the guarantees of origin is administratively taken into account in the level of financial support; or\n(c)\nwhere the guarantees of origin are not issued directly to the producer but to a supplier or consumer who buys the energy from renewable sources either in a competitive setting or in a long-term renewables power purchase agreement.\nin order to take into account the market value of the guarantee of origin, member states may, inter alia, decide to issue a guarantee of origin to the producer and immediately cancel it.\nthe guarantee of origin shall have no function in terms of a member state's compliance with article 3. transfers of guarantees of origin, separately or together with the physical transfer of energy, shall have no effect on the decision of member states to use statistical transfers, joint projects or joint support schemes for compliance with article 3 or on the calculation of the gross final consumption of energy from renewable sources in accordance with article 7.\n3.   for the purposes of paragraph 1, guarantees of origin shall be valid for 12 months after the production of the relevant energy unit. member states shall ensure that all guarantees of origin that have not been cancelled expire at the latest 18 months after the production of the energy unit. member states shall include expired guarantees of origin in the calculation of their residual energy mix.\n4.   for the purposes of disclosure referred to in paragraphs 8 and 13, member states shall ensure that energy companies cancel guarantees of origin at the latest six months after the end of the validity of the guarantee of origin.\n5.   member states or designated competent bodies shall supervise the issuance, transfer and cancellation of guarantees of origin. the designated competent bodies shall not have

installation where the energy was produced;\n(d)\nwhether the installation has benefited from investment support and whether the unit of energy has benefited in any other way from a national support scheme, and the type of support scheme;\n(e)\nthe date on which the installation became operational; and\n(f)\nthe date and country of issue and a unique identification number.\nsimplified information

its energy mix for the purposes of point (a) of article 3(9) of directive 2009/72/ec, it shall do so by using guarantees of origin except:\n(a)\nas regards the share of its energy mix corresponding to non-tracked commercial offers, if any, for which the supplier may use the residual mix; or\n(b)\nwhere a member state decides not to issue guarantees of origin to a producer that receives financial support from a support scheme.\nwhere member states have arranged to have guarantees of origin for other types of energy, suppliers shall use for disclosure the same type of guarantees of origin as the energy supplied. likewise, guarantees of origin created pursuant to article 14(10) of directive 2012/27/eu may be used to substantiate any requirement to demonstrate the quantity of electricity produced from high-efficiency cogeneration. for the purposes of paragraph 2 of this article, where electricity is generated from high-efficiency cogeneration using renewable sources, only one

cost-benefit assessment which shall be undertaken in accordance with the principles laid down in annex ii.\n3.   member states that proceed with the deployment of smart metering systems shall adopt and publish the minimum functional and technical requirements for the smart metering systems to be deployed in their territories, in accordance with article 20 and annex ii. member states shall ensure the interoperability of those smart metering systems, as well as their ability to provide output for consumer energy management systems. in that respect, member states shall have due regard to the use of the relevant available standards, including those enabling interoperability, to best practices and to the importance of the development of smart grids and the development of the internal market for electricity.\n4.   member states that proceed with the deployment of smart metering systems shall ensure that final customers contribute to the associated costs of the deployment in a transparent and non-discriminatory manner, while taking into account the long-term benefits to the whole value chain. member states or, where a member state has so provided, the designated competent authorities, shall regularly monitor such deployment in their territories to track the delivery of benefits to consumers.\n5.   where the deployment of smart metering systems has been negatively assessed as a result of the cost-benefit assessment referred to in paragraph 2, member states shall ensure that this assessment is revised at least every four years, or more frequently, in response to significant changes in the underlying assumptions and in response to technological and market developments. member states shall notify to the commission the outcome of their updated cost-benefit assessment as it becomes available.\n6.   the provisions in this directive concerning smart metering systems shall apply to future installations and to installations that replace older smart meters. smart metering systems that have already been installed, or for which the ‘start of works’ began, before 4 july 2019, may remain in operation over their lifetime but, in the case of smart metering systems that do not meet the requirements of article 20 and annex ii, shall not remain in operation after 5 july 2031.\nfor the purpose of this paragraph, ‘start of works’ means either the start of construction works on the investment or the first firm commitment to order equipment or other commitment that makes the investment irreversible, whichever is the first in time. buying of land and preparatory works such as obtaining permits and conducting preliminary feasibility studies are not considered as start of works. for take-overs, ‘start of works’ means the moment of acquiring the assets directly linked to the acquired establishment.\n\n**Task**: Convert this article into a valid **RDF/Turtle** representation using the POLIANNA ontology, as specified in the system instructions."}, {"role": "assistant",

shall strongly recommend that electricity undertakings and other market participants optimise the use of electricity, inter alia, by providing energy management services, developing innovative pricing formulas, and introducing smart metering systems that are interoperable, in particular with consumer energy management systems and with smart grids, in accordance with the applicable union data protection rules.\n2.   member states shall ensure the deployment in their territories of smart metering systems that assist the active participation of customers in the electricity market. such deployment may be subject to a cost-benefit assessment which shall be undertaken in accordance with the principles laid down in annex ii.\n3.   member states that proceed with the deployment of smart metering systems shall adopt and publish the minimum functional and technical requirements for the smart metering systems to be deployed in their territories, in accordance with article 20 and annex ii. member states shall ensure the interoperability of those smart metering systems, as well as their ability to provide output for consumer energy management systems. in that respect, member states shall have due regard to the use of the relevant available standards, including those enabling interoperability, to best practices and to the importance of the development of smart grids and the development of the internal market for electricity.\n4.   member states that proceed with the deployment of smart metering systems shall ensure that final customers contribute to the associated costs of the deployment in a transparent and non-discriminatory manner, while taking into account the long-term benefits to the whole value chain. member states or, where a member state has so provided, the designated competent authorities, shall regularly monitor such deployment in their territories to track the delivery of benefits to consumers.\n5.   where the deployment of smart metering systems has been negatively assessed as a result of the cost-benefit assessment referred to in paragraph 2, member states shall ensure that this assessment is revised at least every four years, or more frequently, in response to significant changes in the underlying assumptions and in response to technological and market developments. member states shall notify to the commission the outcome of their updated cost-benefit assessment as it becomes available.\n6.   the provisions in this directive concerning smart metering systems shall apply to future installations and to installations that replace older smart meters. smart metering systems that have already been installed, or for which the ‘start of works’ began, before 4 july 2019, may remain in operation over their lifetime but, in the case of smart metering systems that do not meet the requirements of article 20 and annex ii, shall not remain in operation after 5 july 2031.\nfor the purpose of this paragraph, ‘start of works’ means either the start of construction works on the investment or the first firm commitment to order equipment or other commitment that makes the investment irreversible, whichever is the first in time. buying of land and preparatory works such as obtaining permits and conducting preliminary feasibility studies are not considered as start of works. for take-overs, ‘start of works’ means the moment of acquiring the assets directly linked to the acquired establishment.\"\"\"^^xsd:string ;\n    pol:grants_monitoring_authority <http://eurovoc.europa.eu/4038>,\n
