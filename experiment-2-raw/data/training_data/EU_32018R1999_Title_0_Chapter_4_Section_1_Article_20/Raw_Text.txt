article 20
integrated reporting on renewable energy
member states shall include in the integrated national energy and climate progress reports information:
(a)
on the implementation of the following trajectories and objectives:
(1)
indicative national trajectory for the overall share of renewable energy in gross final energy consumption from 2021 to 2030;
(2)
estimated trajectories for the sectoral share of renewable energy in final energy consumption from 2021 to 2030 in the electricity, heating and cooling and transport sector;
(3)
estimated trajectories per renewable energy technology to achieve the overall and sectoral trajectories for renewable energy from 2021 to 2030, including total expected gross final energy consumption per technology and sector in mtoe and total planned installed capacity per technology and sector in mw;
(4)
trajectories on bioenergy demand, disaggregated between heat, electricity and transport, and on biomass supply, by feedstock and origin (distinguishing between domestic production and imports). for forest biomass, an assessment of its source and impact on the lulucf sink;
(5)
where applicable, other national trajectories and objectives, including those that are long-term and sectoral (such as share of electricity produced from biomass without the utilisation of heat, share of renewable energy in district heating, renewable energy use in buildings, renewable energy produced by cities, renewable energy communities and renewables self-consumers), energy recovered from the sludge acquired through the treatment of wastewater;
(b)
on the implementation of the following policies and measures:
(1)
implemented, adopted and planned policies and measures to achieve the national contribution to the 2030 binding union target for renewable energy as indicated in point (a)(2) of article 4 of this regulation, including sector- and technology-specific measures, with a specific review of the implementation of measures laid down in articles 23 to 28 of directive (eu) 2018/2001;
(2)
where available, specific measures for regional cooperation;
(3)
without prejudice to articles 107 and 108 tfeu, specific measures on financial support, including union support and the use of union funds, for the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources in electricity, heating and cooling, and transport;
(4)
when applicable, the assessment of the support for electricity from renewable sources that member states are to carry out pursuant to article 6(4) of directive (eu) 2018/2001;
(5)
specific measures to fulfil the requirements of articles 15 to 18 of directive (eu) 2018/2001;
(6)
where applicable, specific measures to assess, make transparent and reduce the need for must-run capacity that can lead to curtailment of energy from renewable sources;
(7)
a summary of the policies and measures under the enabling framework member states are to put in place pursuant to article 21(6) and article 22(5) of directive (eu) 2018/2001 to promote and facilitate the development of renewables self-consumption and renewable energy communities;
(8)
measures promoting the use of energy from biomass, especially for new biomass mobilisation taking into account biomass, including sustainable biomass availability as well as measures for the sustainability of biomass produced and used;
(9)
measures in place to increase the share of renewable energy in the heating and cooling and transport sector;
(10)
policies and measures facilitating the uptake of power purchase agreements;
(c)
as set out in part 1 of annex ix.
