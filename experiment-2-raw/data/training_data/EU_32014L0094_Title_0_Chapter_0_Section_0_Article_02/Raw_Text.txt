(7)
‘recharging or refuelling point accessible to the public’ means a recharging or refuelling point to supply an alternative fuel which provides union-wide non-discriminatory access to users. non-discriminatory access may include different terms of authentication, use and payment;
(8)
‘refuelling point’ means a refuelling facility for the provision of any fuel with the exception of lng, through a fixed or a mobile installation;
