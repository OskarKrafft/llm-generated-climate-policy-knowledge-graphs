specifically related to Article 5, Paragraph 1, and its subclauses. The content of each subclause is identical, which suggests that there might have been an error in the transcription or formatting process.\n\nIf this is indeed part of a legal document, it's crucial to ensure that each subclause contains unique information relevant to the regulation being described. Here\u2019s a simplified version with just one subclause for clarity:\n\n---\n\n**Article 5**\n\n**Paragraph 1**\n\n**SubClause 1.1:**\nWhere a member state requires that the obligation to renovate each year 3% of the total floor area is extended to buildings owned and occupied by its central government, the 3% rate shall be calculated on the total floor area of buildings with a total useful floor area over 250 m\u00b2 owned and occupied by the central government of the member state concerned that, on 1 January of each year, do not meet the national minimum energy performance requirements set in application of Article 4 of Directive 2010/31/EU.\n\n---\n\nIf you need to include multiple subclauses with different content, please provide the specific details for each one. If this is a formatting issue and all subclauses are meant to be identical, then the above simplified version can be used as a template for the entire paragraph.",

specifically related to Article 5, Paragraph 1, and its subclauses. The content of each subclause is identical, which suggests that there might have been an error in the transcription or formatting process.\n\nIf this is indeed part of a legal document, it's crucial to ensure that each subclause contains unique information relevant to the regulation being described. Here\u2019s a simplified version with just one subclause for clarity:\n\n---\n\n**Article 5**\n\n**Paragraph 1**\n\n**SubClause 1.1:**\nWhere a member state requires that the obligation to renovate each year 3% of the total floor area is extended to buildings owned and occupied by its central government, the 3% rate shall be calculated on the total floor area of buildings with a total useful floor area over 250 m\u00b2 owned and occupied by the central government of the member state concerned that, on 1 January of each year, do not meet the national minimum energy performance requirements set in application of Article 4 of Directive 2010/31/EU.\n\n---\n\nIf you need to include multiple subclauses with different content, please provide the specific details for each one. If this is a formatting issue and all subclauses are meant to be identical, then the above simplified version can be used as a template for the entire paragraph.",

specifically related to Article 5, Paragraph 1, and its subclauses. The content of each subclause is identical, which suggests that there might have been an error in the transcription or formatting process.\n\nIf this is indeed part of a legal document, it's crucial to ensure that each subclause contains unique information relevant to the regulation being described. Here\u2019s a simplified version with just one subclause for clarity:\n\n---\n\n**Article 5**\n\n**Paragraph 1**\n\n**SubClause 1.1:**\nWhere a member state requires that the obligation to renovate each year 3% of the total floor area is extended to buildings owned and occupied by its central government, the 3% rate shall be calculated on the total floor area of buildings with a total useful floor area over 250 m\u00b2 owned and occupied by the central government of the member state concerned that, on 1 January of each year, do not meet the national minimum energy performance requirements set in application of Article 4 of Directive 2010/31/EU.\n\n---\n\nIf you need to include multiple subclauses with different content, please provide the specific details for each one. If this is a formatting issue and all subclauses are meant to be identical, then the above simplified version can be used as a template for the entire paragraph.",
