It includes information about the type, title, CELEX number, annotators, submission date, and various elements that the article encompasses.\n\nThe CELEX number (32018R1999) is a unique identifier used by the European Union to reference legal acts. The article appears to be part of a regulation concerning energy efficiency and sustainability in buildings, as indicated by references to directives like 2003/87/ec (likely related to greenhouse gas emissions trading), 2009/72/ec and 2009/73/ec (possibly related to energy performance of buildings), and 2010/31/ec (which is indeed about the energy performance of buildings).\n\nThe article mandates periodic reporting on various aspects including carbon market functioning, bioenergy sustainability, voluntary schemes, progress towards nearly zero-energy buildings, competitiveness, and the implementation of the EU's energy union strategy. These reports are to be submitted biennially or every four years as specified.\n\nThis structured format allows for easy parsing and integration into databases or other systems where such metadata might be useful for legal compliance checks, research purposes, or policy analysis.",
