<|im_start|><|im_start|>
<|im_start|>It appears that you have provided a structured representation of an article, likely from a legal or regulatory document, detailing EU fleet-wide emission targets for passenger cars and light commercial vehicles. The structure is repetitive, with each section (from Article_1_1_text to Article_1_20_text) stating the same content about the application of these targets starting from January 1, 2030.

Here's a summary of what you've provided:

- **Article_1** contains multiple parts (1 through 20).
- Each part has two sub-parts: (a) and (b).
- Sub-part (a) refers to the EU fleet-wide target for new passenger cars.
- Sub-part (b) refers to the EU fleet-wide target for new light commercial vehicles.
- The targets are described as a 15% reduction of some unspecified baseline or previous target, determined in accordance with point 6.1.1 of part A of an annex (likely Annex I).
- All parts state that these targets shall apply from January 1, 2030.
