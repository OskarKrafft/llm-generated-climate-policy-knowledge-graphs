The commission shall publish reports with its conclusions: on the first EEAPS before 1 January 2008; on the second EEAPS before 1 January 2012; on the third EEAPS before 1 January 2015. These reports shall include information on related action at community level, including legislation currently in force and future legislation. The reports shall take into account the benchmarking system referred to in article 15(4), identify best practices, identify cases where member states and/or the commission are not making enough progress, and may contain recommendations. The second report shall be followed, as appropriate and where necessary, by proposals to the European Parliament and to the Council for additional measures including a possible extension of the period of application of targets. If the report concludes that insufficient progress has been made towards achieving the national indicative targets, these proposals shall address the level and nature of the targets."
