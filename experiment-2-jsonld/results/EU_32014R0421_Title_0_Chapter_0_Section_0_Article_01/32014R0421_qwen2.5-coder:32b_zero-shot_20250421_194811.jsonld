It seems like this is a repetitive statement for each article. Is there a more concise way to express this?
Certainly! You can consolidate the repetitive statements into a single, general clause that applies to all articles. Here's a more concise version:

---

By way of derogation from Articles 1 through 50, the provisions of each Article shall apply to flights referred to in paragraph 1 only if:
(a) they are performed by aircraft operators established in third countries;
(b) they involve any landing or take-off at an aerodrome located in a Member State; and
(c) they do not involve any landing or take-off at an aerodrome located in another third country.

This version clearly states the conditions that apply to all articles from 1 through 50 without repeating the same text for each one.
