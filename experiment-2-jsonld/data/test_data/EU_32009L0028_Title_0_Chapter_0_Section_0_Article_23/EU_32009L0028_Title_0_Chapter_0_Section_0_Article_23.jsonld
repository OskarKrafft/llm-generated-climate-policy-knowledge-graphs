and\n(f)\nindirect land-use changes in relation to all production pathways.\nthe commission shall, if appropriate, propose corrective action.\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0on the basis of the reports submitted by member states pursuant to article\u00a022(3), the commission shall analyse the effectiveness of measures taken by member states on establishing a single administrative body responsible for processing authorisation, certification and licensing applications and providing assistance to applicants.\n7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0in order to improve financing and coordination with a view to the achievement of the 20\u00a0% target referred to in article\u00a03(1), the commission shall, by 31\u00a0december 2010, present an analysis and action plan on energy from renewable sources with a view, in particular, to:\n(a)\nthe better use of structural funds and framework programmes;\n(b)\nthe better and increased use of funds from the european investment bank and other public finance institutions;\n(c)\nbetter access to risk capital notably by analysing the feasibility of a risk sharing facility for investments in energy from renewable sources in the community similar to the global energy efficiency and renewable energy fund initiative which is aimed at third countries;\n(d)\nthe better coordination of community and national funding and other forms of support; and\n(e)\nthe better coordination in support of renewable energy initiatives whose success depends on action by actors in several member states.\n8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0by 31\u00a0december 2014, the commission shall present a report, addressing, in particular, the following elements:\n(a)\na review of the minimum greenhouse gas emission saving thresholds to apply from the dates referred to in the second subparagraph of article\u00a017(2), on the basis of an impact assessment taking into account, in particular, technological developments, available technologies and the availability of first and second-generation bio-fuels with a high level of greenhouse gas emission saving;\n(b)\nwith respect to the target referred to in article\u00a03(4), a review of:\n(i)\nthe cost-efficiency of the measures to be implemented to achieve the target;\n(ii)\nan assessment of the feasibility of reaching the target whilst ensuring the sustainability of biofuels production in the community and in third countries, and considering economic, environmental and social impacts, including indirect effects and impacts on biodiversity, as well as the commercial availability of second-generation biofuels;\n(iii)\nthe impact of the implementation of the target on the availability of foodstuffs at affordable prices;\n(iv)\nthe commercial availability of electric, hybrid and hydrogen powered vehicles, as well as the methodology chosen to calculate the share of energy from renewable sources consumed in the transport sector;\n(v)\nthe evaluation of specific market conditions, considering, in particular, markets on which transport fuels represent more than half of the final energy consumption, and markets which are fully dependent on imported biofuels;\n(c)\nan evaluation of the implementation of this directive, in particular with regard to cooperation mechanisms, in order to ensure that, together with the possibility for the members states to continue to use national support schemes referred to in article\u00a03(3), those mechanisms enable member states to achieve the national targets defined in annex\u00a0i on the best cost-benefit basis, of technological developments, and the conclusions to be drawn to achieve the target of 20\u00a0% of energy from renewable sources at community level.\non the basis of that report, the commission shall submit, if appropriate, proposals to the european parliament and the council, addressing the above elements and in particular:\n\u2014\nfor the element contained in point\u00a0(a), a modification of the minimum greenhouse gas emission saving referred to in that point, and\n\u2014\nfor the element contained in point\u00a0(c), appropriate adjustments of the cooperation measures provided for in this directive in order to improve their effectiveness for achieving the target of 20\u00a0%. such proposals shall neither affect the 20\u00a0% target nor member states\u2019 control over national support schemes and cooperation measures.\n9.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0in 2018, the commission shall present a renewable energy roadmap for the post-2020 period.\nthat roadmap shall, if appropriate, be accompanied by proposals to the european parliament and the council for the period after 2020. the roadmap shall take into account the experience of the implementation of this directive and technological developments in energy from renewable sources.\n10.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0in 2021, the commission shall present a report reviewing the application of this directive. that report shall, in particular, address the role of the following elements in having enabled member states to achieve the national targets defined in annex\u00a0i on the best cost-benefit basis:\n(a)\nthe process of preparing forecasts and national renewable energy action plans;\n(b)\nthe effectiveness of the cooperation mechanisms;\n(c)\ntechnological developments in energy from renewable sources, including the development of the use of biofuels in commercial aviation;\n(d)\nthe effectiveness of the national support schemes;
