2015 instead of 30 april 2014, and verified 2013 emissions for those flights being reported by 31 march 2015 instead of 31 march 2014.\nfor the purposes of articles 11a, 12 and 14, the verified emissions from flights other than those referred to in the first subparagraph shall be considered to be the verified emissions of the aircraft operator.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0by way of derogation from

considered to be verified emissions if determined by using the small emitters tool approved under commission regulation (eu) no 606/2010\u00a0(5) and populated by eurocontrol with data from its ets support facility. member states may implement simplified procedures for non-commercial aircraft operators as long as such procedures provide no less accuracy than the small emitters tool provides.\n7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0for the purposes of this article, flights between aerodromes located in states of the eea and countries that acceded to the union in 2013 shall be considered to be
