states shall carry out and notify to the commission a comprehensive assessment of the potential for the application of high-efficiency cogeneration and efficient district heating and cooling, containing the information set out in annex viii. if they have already carried out an equivalent assessment, they shall notify it to the commission.\nthe comprehensive assessment shall take full account of the analysis of the national potentials for high-efficiency cogeneration carried out under directive 2004/8/ec.\nat the request of the commission, the assessment shall be updated and notified to the commission every five years. the commission shall make any such request at least one year before the due date.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0member states shall adopt policies which encourage the due taking into account at local and regional levels of the potential of using efficient heating and cooling systems, in particular those using high-efficiency cogeneration. account shall be taken of the potential for developing local and regional heat markets.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0for the purpose of the assessment referred to in paragraph 1, member states shall carry out a cost-benefit analysis covering their territory based on climate conditions, economic feasibility and technical suitability in accordance with part 1 of annex ix. the cost-benefit analysis shall be capable of facilitating the identification of the most resource-and cost-efficient solutions to meeting heating and cooling needs. that cost-benefit analysis may be part of an environmental assessment under directive 2001/42/ec of the european parliament and of the council of 27 june 2001 on the assessment of the effects of certain plans and programmes on the environment\u00a0(25).\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0where the assessment referred to in paragraph 1 and the analysis referred to in paragraph 3 identify a potential for the application of high-efficiency cogeneration and/or efficient district heating and cooling whose benefits exceed the costs, member states shall take adequate measures for efficient district heating and cooling infrastructure to be developed and/or to accommodate the development of high-efficiency cogeneration and the use of heating and cooling from waste heat and renewable energy sources in accordance with paragraphs 1, 5, and 7.\nwhere the assessment referred to in paragraph 1 and the analysis referred to in paragraph 3 do not identify a potential whose benefits exceed the costs, including the administrative costs of carrying out the cost-benefit analysis referred to in paragraph 5, the member state concerned may exempt installations from the requirements laid down in that paragraph.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0member states shall ensure that a cost-benefit analysis in accordance with part 2 of annex ix is carried out when, after 5 june 2014:\n(a)\na new thermal electricity generation installation with a total thermal input exceeding 20\u00a0mw is planned, in order to assess the cost and benefits of providing for the operation of the installation as a high-efficiency cogeneration installation;\n(b)\nan

high-efficiency cogeneration;\n(c)\nan industrial installation with a total thermal input exceeding 20\u00a0mw generating waste heat at a useful temperature level is planned or substantially refurbished, in order to assess the cost and benefits of utilising the waste heat to satisfy economically justified demand, including through cogeneration, and of the connection of that installation to a district heating and cooling network;\n(d)\na new district heating and cooling network is planned or in an existing district heating or cooling network a new energy production installation with a total thermal input exceeding 20\u00a0mw is planned or an existing such installation is to be substantially refurbished, in order to assess the cost and benefits of utilising the waste heat from nearby industrial installations.\nthe fitting of equipment to capture carbon dioxide produced by a combustion installation with a view to its being geologically stored as provided for in directive 2009/31/ec shall not be considered as refurbishment for the purpose of points (b), (c) and (d) of this paragraph.\nmember states may require the cost-benefit analysis referred to in points (c) and (d) to be carried out in cooperation with the companies responsible for the operation of the district heating and cooling networks.\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0member states may exempt from paragraph 5:\n(a)\nthose peak load and back-up electricity generating installations which are planned to operate under 1\u00a0500 operating hours per year as a rolling average over a period of five years, based on a verification procedure established by the member states ensuring that this exemption criterion is met;\n(b)\nnuclear power installations;\n(c)\ninstallations that need to be located close to a geological storage site approved under directive 2009/31/ec.\nmember states may also lay down thresholds, expressed in terms of the amount of available useful waste heat, the demand for heat or the distances between industrial installations and district heating networks, for exempting individual installations from the provisions of points (c) and (d) of paragraph 5.\nmember states shall notify exemptions adopted under this paragraph to the commission by 31 december 2013 and any subsequent changes to them thereafter.\n7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0member states shall adopt authorisation criteria as referred to in article 7 of directive 2009/72/ec, or equivalent permit criteria, to:\n(a)\ntake into account the outcome of the comprehensive assessment referred to in paragraph 1;\n(b)\nensure that the requirements of paragraph 5 are fulfilled; and\n(c)\ntake into account the outcome of cost-benefit analysis referred to in paragraph 5.\n8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0member states may exempt individual installations from being required, by the authorisation and permit criteria referred to in paragraph 7, to implement options whose benefits exceed their costs, if there are imperative reasons of law, ownership or finance for so doing. in these cases the member state concerned shall submit a reasoned notification of its decision to the commission within three months of the date of taking it.\n9.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0paragraphs 5, 6, 7 and 8 of this article shall apply to installations covered by directive 2010/75/eu without prejudice to the requirements of that directive.\n10.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0on the basis of the harmonised efficiency reference values referred to in point (f) of annex ii, member states shall ensure that the origin of electricity produced from high-efficiency cogeneration can be guaranteed according to objective, transparent and non-discriminatory criteria laid down by each member state. they shall ensure that this guarantee of origin complies with the requirements and contains at least the information specified in annex x. member states shall mutually recognise their guarantees of origin, exclusively as proof of the information referred to in this paragraph. any refusal to recognise a guarantee of origin as such proof, in particular for reasons relating to the prevention of fraud, must be based on objective, transparent and non-discriminatory criteria. member states shall notify the commission of such refusal and its justification. in the event of refusal to recognise a guarantee of origin, the commission may adopt a decision to compel the refusing party to recognise it, in particular with regard to objective, transparent and non-discriminatory criteria on which such recognition is based.\nthe commission shall be empowered to review, by means of delegated acts in accordance with article 23 of this directive, the harmonised efficiency reference values laid down in commission implementing decision 2011/877/eu\u00a0(26) on the basis of directive 2004/8/ec by 31 december 2014.\n11.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0member states shall ensure that any available support for cogeneration is subject to the

2020, without prejudice to paragraph 2.\nthat target shall be at least equivalent to achieving new savings each year from 1 january 2014 to 31 december 2020 of 1,5\u00a0% of the annual energy sales to final customers of all energy distributors or all retail energy sales companies by volume, averaged over the most recent three-year period prior to 1 january 2013. the sales of energy, by volume, used in transport may be partially or fully excluded from this calculation.\nmember states shall decide how the calculated quantity of new savings referred to in the second subparagraph is to be phased

measured and verified, towards the amount of energy savings referred to in paragraph 1.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the application of paragraph 2 shall not lead to a reduction of more than 25\u00a0% of the amount of energy savings referred to in paragraph 1. member states making use of paragraph 2 shall notify that fact to the commission by 5 june 2014, including the elements listed under paragraph 2 to be applied and a calculation showing their impact on the amount of energy savings referred to in paragraph 1.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0without prejudice to the calculation of energy savings for the target in accordance with the second subparagraph of paragraph 1, each member state shall, for the purposes of the first subparagraph of paragraph 1, designate, on the basis of objective and non-discriminatory criteria, obligated parties amongst energy distributors and/or retail energy sales companies operating in its territory and may include transport fuel distributors or transport fuel retailers operating in its territory. the amount of energy savings to fulfil the obligation shall be achieved by the obligated parties among final customers, designated, as appropriate, by the member state, independently of the calculation made pursuant to paragraph 1, or, if member states so decide, through certified savings stemming from other parties as described in point (b) of paragraph 7.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0member states shall express the amount of energy savings required of each obligated party in terms of either final or primary energy consumption. the method chosen for expressing the required amount of energy savings shall also be used for calculating the savings claimed by obligated parties. the conversion factors set out in annex iv shall apply.\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0member states shall ensure that the savings stemming from paragraphs 1, 2 and 9 of this article and article 20(6) are calculated in accordance with points (1) and (2) of annex v. they shall put in place measurement, control and verification systems under which at least a statistically significant proportion and representative sample of the energy efficiency improvement measures put in place by the obligated parties is verified. that measurement, control and verification shall be conducted independently of the obligated parties.\n7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0within the energy efficiency obligation scheme, member states may:\n(a)\ninclude requirements with a social aim in the saving obligations they impose, including by requiring a share of energy efficiency measures to be implemented as a priority in households affected by energy poverty or in social housing;\n(b)\npermit obligated parties to count towards their obligation certified energy savings achieved by energy service providers or other third parties, including when obligated parties promote measures through other state-approved bodies or through public

in accordance with the second subparagraph of paragraph 1, each member state shall, for the purposes of the first subparagraph of paragraph 1, designate, on the basis of objective and non-discriminatory criteria, obligated parties amongst energy distributors and/or retail energy sales companies operating in its territory and may include transport fuel distributors or transport fuel retailers operating in its territory. the amount of energy savings to fulfil the obligation shall be achieved by the obligated parties among final customers, designated, as appropriate, by the member state, independently of the calculation made pursuant to paragraph 1, or, if member states so decide, through certified savings stemming from other parties as described in point (b) of paragraph 7.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0member states shall express the amount of energy savings required of each obligated party in terms of either final or primary energy consumption. the method chosen for expressing the required amount of energy savings shall also be used for calculating the savings claimed by obligated parties. the conversion factors set out in annex iv shall apply.\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0member states shall ensure that the savings stemming from paragraphs 1, 2 and 9 of this article and article 20(6) are calculated in accordance with points (1) and (2) of annex v. they shall put in place measurement, control and verification systems under which at least a statistically significant proportion and representative sample of the energy efficiency improvement measures put in place by the obligated parties is verified. that measurement, control and verification shall be conducted independently of the obligated parties.\n7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0within the energy efficiency obligation scheme, member states may:\n(a)\ninclude requirements with a social aim in the saving obligations they impose, including by requiring a share of energy efficiency measures to be implemented as a priority in households affected by energy poverty or in social housing;\n(b)\npermit obligated parties to count towards their obligation certified energy savings achieved by energy service providers or other third parties, including when obligated parties promote measures through other state-approved bodies or through public authorities that may or may not involve formal partnerships and may be in combination with other sources of finance. where member states so permit, they shall ensure that an approval process is in place which is clear, transparent and open to all market actors, and which aims at minimising the costs of certification;\n(c)\nallow obligated parties to count savings obtained in a given year as if they had instead been obtained in any of the four previous or three following years.\n8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0once a year, member states shall publish the energy savings achieved by each obligated party, or each sub\u2010category of obligated party, and in total under the scheme.\nmember states shall ensure that obligated parties provide on request:\n(a)\naggregated statistical information on their final customers (identifying significant changes to previously submitted information); and\n(b)\ncurrent information on final customers\u2019 consumption, including, where applicable, load profiles, customer segmentation and geographical location of customers, while preserving the integrity and confidentiality of private or commercially sensitive information in compliance with applicable union law.\nsuch a request shall be made not more than once a year.\n9.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0as an alternative to setting up an energy efficiency obligation scheme under paragraph 1, member states may opt to take other policy measures to achieve energy savings among final customers, provided those policy measures meet the criteria set out in paragraphs 10 and 11. the annual amount of new energy savings achieved through this approach shall be equivalent to the amount of new energy savings required by paragraphs 1, 2 and 3. provided that equivalence is maintained, member states may combine obligation schemes with alternative policy measures, including national energy efficiency programmes.\nthe policy measures referred to in the first subparagraph may include, but are not restricted to, the following policy measures or combinations thereof:\n(a)\nenergy or co2 taxes that have the effect of reducing end\u2010use energy consumption;\n(b)\nfinancing schemes and instruments or fiscal incentives that lead to the application of energy\u2010efficient technology or techniques and have the effect of reducing end\u2010use energy consumption;\n(c)\nregulations or voluntary agreements that lead to the application of energy\u2010efficient technology or techniques and have the effect of reducing end\u2010use energy consumption;\n(d)\nstandards and norms that aim at improving the energy efficiency of products and services, including buildings and vehicles, except where these are mandatory and applicable in member states under union law;\n(e)\nenergy labelling schemes, with the exception of those that are mandatory and applicable in the member states under union law;\n(f)\ntraining and education, including energy advisory programmes, that lead to the application of energy\u2010efficient technology or techniques and have the effect of reducing end\u2010use energy consumption.\nmember states shall notify to the commission, by 5 december 2013, the policy measures that they plan to adopt for the purposes of the first subparagraph and article 20(6), following the framework provided in point 4 of annex v, and showing how they would achieve the required amount of savings. in the case of the policy measures referred to in the second subparagraph and in article 20(6), this notification shall demonstrate how the criteria in paragraph 10 are met. in the case of policy measures other than those referred to in the second subparagraph or in article 20(6), member states shall explain how an equivalent level of savings, monitoring and verification is achieved. the commission may make suggestions for modifications in the three months following notification.\n10.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0without prejudice to paragraph 11, the criteria for the policy measures taken pursuant to the second subparagraph of paragraph 9 and article 20(6) shall be as follows:\n(a)\nthe policy measures provide for at least two intermediate periods by 31 december 2020 and lead to the achievement of the level of ambition set out in paragraph 1;\n(b)\nthe responsibility of each entrusted party, participating party or implementing public authority, whichever is relevant, is defined;\n(c)\nthe energy savings that are to be achieved are determined in a transparent manner;\n(d)\nthe amount of energy savings required or to be achieved by the policy measure are expressed in either final or primary energy consumption, using the conversion factors set out in annex iv;\n(e)\nenergy savings are calculated using the methods and principles provided in points (1) and (2) of annex v;\n(f)\nenergy savings are calculated using the methods and principles provided in point 3 of annex v;\n(g)\nan annual report of the energy savings achieved is provided by participating parties unless not feasible and made publicly available;\n(h)\nmonitoring of the results is ensured and appropriate measures are envisaged if the progress is not satisfactory;\n(i)\na control system is put in place that also includes independent verification of a statistically significant proportion of the energy efficiency improvement measures;\n(j)\ndata on the annual trend of energy savings are published annually.\n11.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0member states shall ensure that the taxes referred to in point (a) of the second subparagraph of paragraph 9 comply with the criteria listed in points (a), (b), (c), (d), (f), (h) and (j) of paragraph 10.\nmember states shall ensure that the regulations and voluntary agreements referred to in point (c) of the second subparagraph of paragraph 9 comply with the criteria listed in points (a), (b), (c), (d), (e), (g), (h), (i) and (j) of paragraph 10.\nmember states shall ensure that the other policy measures referred to in the second subparagraph of paragraph 9 and the energy efficiency national funds referred to in article 20(6) comply with the criteria listed in points (a), (b), (c), (d), (e), (h), (i) and (j) of paragraph 10.\n12.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0member states shall ensure that when the impact of policy measures or individual actions overlaps, no double counting of energy savings is made.\n\"\"\" ;\n

the european parliament and the council on the impact on social sustainability in the community and in third countries of increased demand for biofuel, on the impact of community biofuel policy on the availability of foodstuffs at affordable prices, in particular for people living in developing countries, and wider development issues. reports shall address the respect of land-use rights. they shall state, both for third countries and member states that are a significant source of raw material for biofuel consumed within the community, whether the country has ratified and implemented each of the following conventions of the international labour organisation:\n\u2014 convention concerning forced or compulsory labour (no\u00a029),\n\u2014 convention concerning freedom of association and protection of the right to organise (no\u00a087),\n\u2014 convention concerning the application of the principles of the right to organise and to bargain collectively (no\u00a098),\n\u2014 convention concerning equal remuneration of men and women workers for work of equal value (no\u00a0100),\n\u2014 convention concerning the abolition of forced labour (no\u00a0105),\n\u2014 convention concerning discrimination in respect of employment and occupation (no\u00a0111),\n\u2014 convention concerning minimum age for admission to employment (no\u00a0138),\n\u2014 convention concerning the prohibition and immediate action for the elimination of the worst forms of child labour (no\u00a0182).\nthose reports shall state, both for third countries and member states that are a significant source of raw material for biofuel consumed within the community, whether the country has ratified and implemented:\n\u2014 the cartagena protocol on biosafety,\n\u2014 the convention on international trade in endangered species of wild fauna and flora.\nthe first report shall be submitted in 2012. the commission shall, if appropriate, propose corrective action, in particular if evidence shows that biofuel production has a significant impact on food prices.\n8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0for the purposes referred to in points\u00a0(a), (b) and\u00a0(c) of paragraph\u00a01, member states shall not refuse to take into account, on other sustainability grounds, biofuels and bioliquids obtained in compliance with this article.\n9.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the commission shall report on requirements for a sustainability scheme for energy uses of biomass, other than biofuels and bioliquids, by 31\u00a0december 2009. that report shall be accompanied, where appropriate, by proposals for a sustainability scheme for other energy uses of biomass, to the european parliament and the council. that report and any proposals contained therein shall be based on the best available scientific evidence, taking into account new developments in innovative processes. if the analysis done for that purpose demonstrates that it would be appropriate to introduce amendments, in relation to forest biomass, in the calculation methodology in annex\u00a0v or in the sustainability criteria relating to carbon stocks applied to biofuels and bioliquids, the commission shall, where appropriate, make proposals to the european parliament and council at the same time in this regard.\" .\n```",

biofuels and bioliquids\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0where biofuels and bioliquids are to be taken into account for the purposes referred to in points\u00a0(a), (b) and\u00a0(c) of article\u00a017(1), member states shall require economic operators to show that the sustainability criteria set out in article\u00a017(2) to\u00a0(5) have been fulfilled. for that purpose they shall require economic operators to use a mass balance system which:\n(a)\nallows consignments of raw material or biofuel with differing sustainability characteristics to be mixed;\n(b)\nrequires information about the sustainability characteristics and sizes of the consignments referred to in point\u00a0(a) to remain assigned to the mixture; and\n(c)\nprovides for the sum of all consignments withdrawn from the mixture to be described as having the same sustainability characteristics, in the same quantities, as the sum of all consignments added to the mixture.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the commission shall report to the european parliament and the council in 2010 and\u00a02012 on the operation of the mass balance verification method described in paragraph\u00a01 and on the potential for allowing for other verification methods in relation to some or all types of raw material, biofuel or bioliquids. in its assessment, the commission shall consider those verification methods in which information about sustainability characteristics need not remain physically assigned to particular consignments or mixtures. the assessment shall take into account the need to maintain the integrity and effectiveness of the verification system while avoiding the imposition of an unreasonable burden on industry. the report shall be accompanied, where appropriate, by proposals to the european parliament and the council concerning the use of other verification methods.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0member states shall take measures to ensure that economic operators submit reliable information and make available to the member state, on request, the data that were used to develop the information. member states shall require economic operators to arrange for an adequate standard of independent auditing of the information submitted, and to provide evidence that this has been done. the auditing shall verify that the systems used by economic operators are accurate, reliable and protected against fraud. it shall evaluate the frequency and methodology of sampling and the robustness of the data.\nthe information referred to in the first subparagraph shall include in particular information on compliance with the sustainability criteria set out in article\u00a017(2) to\u00a0(5), appropriate and relevant information on measures taken for soil, water and air protection, the restoration of degraded land, the avoidance of excessive water consumption in areas where water is scarce and appropriate and relevant information concerning measures taken in order to take into account the issues referred to in the second subparagraph of article\u00a017(7).\nthe commission shall, in accordance with the advisory procedure referred to in article\u00a025(3), establish the list of appropriate and relevant information referred to in the first two subparagraphs. it shall ensure, in particular, that the provision of that information does not represent an excessive administrative burden for operators in general or for smallholder farmers, producer organisations and cooperatives in particular.\nthe obligations laid down in this paragraph shall apply whether the biofuels or bioliquids are produced within the community or imported.\nmember states shall submit to the commission, in aggregated form, the information referred to in the first subparagraph of this paragraph. the commission shall publish that information on the transparency platform referred to in article\u00a024 in summary form preserving the confidentiality of commercially sensitive information.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the community shall endeavour to conclude bilateral or multilateral agreements with third countries containing provisions on sustainability criteria that correspond to those of this directive. where the community has concluded agreements containing provisions relating to matters covered by the sustainability criteria set out in article\u00a017(2) to\u00a0(5), the commission may decide that those agreements demonstrate that biofuels and bioliquids produced from raw materials cultivated in those countries comply with the sustainability criteria in question. when those agreements are concluded, due consideration shall be given to measures taken for the conservation of areas that provide, in critical situations, basic ecosystem services (such as watershed protection and erosion control), for soil, water and air protection, indirect land-use changes, the restoration of degraded land, the avoidance of excessive water consumption in areas where water is scarce and to the issues referred to in the second subparagraph of article\u00a017(7).\nthe commission may decide that voluntary national or international schemes setting standards for the production of biomass products contain accurate data for the purposes of article\u00a017(2) or demonstrate that consignments of biofuel comply with the sustainability criteria set out in article\u00a017(3) to\u00a0(5). the commission may decide that those schemes contain accurate data for the purposes of information on measures taken for the conservation of areas that provide, in critical situations, basic ecosystem services (such as watershed protection and erosion control), for soil, water and air protection, the restoration of degraded land, the avoidance of excessive water consumption in areas where water is scarce and on the issues referred to in the second subparagraph of article\u00a017(7). the commission may also recognise areas for the protection of rare, threatened or endangered ecosystems or species recognised by international agreements or included in lists drawn up by intergovernmental organisations or the international union for the conservation of nature for the purposes of article\u00a017(3)(b)(ii).\nthe commission may decide that voluntary national or international schemes to measure greenhouse gas emission saving contain accurate data for the purposes of article\u00a017(2).\nthe commission may decide that land that falls within the scope of a national or regional recovery programme aimed at improving severely degraded or heavily contaminated land fulfils the criteria referred to in point\u00a09 of part c of annex\u00a0v.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the commission shall adopt decisions under paragraph\u00a04 only if the agreement or scheme in question meets adequate standards of reliability, transparency and independent auditing. in the case of schemes to measure greenhouse gas emission saving, such schemes shall also comply with the methodological requirements in annex\u00a0v. lists of areas of high biodiversity value as referred to in article\u00a017(3)(b)(ii) shall meet adequate standards of objectivity and coherence with internationally recognised standards and provide for appropriate appeal procedures.\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0decisions under paragraph\u00a04 shall be adopted in accordance with the advisory procedure referred to in article\u00a025(3). such decisions shall be valid for a period of no more than five years.\n7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0when an economic operator provides proof or data obtained in accordance with an agreement or scheme that has been the subject of a decision pursuant to paragraph\u00a04, to the extent covered by that decision, a member state shall not require the supplier to provide further evidence of compliance with the sustainability criteria set out in article\u00a017(2) to\u00a0(5) nor information on measures referred to in the second subparagraph of paragraph\u00a03 of this article.\n8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0at the request of a member state or on its own initiative the commission shall examine the application of article\u00a017 in relation to a source of biofuel or bioliquid and, within six months of receipt of a request and in accordance with the advisory procedure referred to in article\u00a025(3), decide whether the member state concerned may take biofuel or bioliquid from that source into account for the purposes referred to in points\u00a0(a), (b) and\u00a0(c) of article\u00a017(1).\n9.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0by 31\u00a0december 2012, the commission shall report to the european parliament and to the council on:\n(a)\nthe effectiveness of the system in place for the provision of information on sustainability criteria; and\n(b)\nwhether it is feasible and appropriate to introduce mandatory

the sustainability criteria for biofuels and bioliquids\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0where biofuels and bioliquids are to be taken into account for the purposes referred to in points\u00a0(a), (b) and\u00a0(c) of article\u00a017(1), member states shall require economic operators to show that the sustainability criteria set out in article\u00a017(2) to\u00a0(5) have been fulfilled. for that purpose they shall require economic operators to use a mass balance system which:\n(a)\nallows consignments of raw material or biofuel with differing sustainability characteristics to be mixed;\n(b)\nrequires information about the sustainability characteristics and sizes of the consignments referred to in point\u00a0(a) to remain assigned to the mixture; and\n(c)\nprovides for the sum of all consignments withdrawn from the mixture to be described as having the same sustainability characteristics, in the same quantities, as the sum of all consignments added to the mixture.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the commission shall report to the european parliament and the council in 2010 and\u00a02012 on the operation of the mass balance verification method described in paragraph\u00a01 and on the potential for allowing for other verification methods in relation to some or all types of raw material, biofuel or bioliquids. in its assessment, the commission shall consider those verification methods in which information about sustainability characteristics need not remain physically assigned to particular consignments or mixtures. the assessment shall take into account the need to maintain the integrity and effectiveness of the verification system while avoiding the imposition of an unreasonable burden on industry. the report shall be accompanied, where appropriate, by proposals to the european parliament and the council concerning the use of other verification methods.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0member states shall take measures to ensure that economic operators submit reliable information and make available to the member state, on request, the data that were used to develop the information. member states shall require economic operators to arrange for an adequate standard of independent auditing of the information submitted, and to provide evidence that this has been done. the auditing shall verify that the systems used by economic operators are accurate, reliable and protected against fraud. it shall evaluate the frequency and methodology of sampling and the robustness of the data.\nthe information referred to in the first subparagraph shall include in particular information on compliance with the sustainability criteria set out in article\u00a017(2) to\u00a0(5), appropriate and relevant information on measures taken for soil, water and air protection, the restoration of degraded land, the avoidance of excessive water consumption in areas where water is scarce and appropriate and relevant information concerning measures taken in order to take into account the issues referred to in the second subparagraph of article\u00a017(7).\nthe commission shall, in accordance with the advisory procedure referred to in article\u00a025(3), establish the list of appropriate and relevant information referred to in the first two subparagraphs. it shall ensure, in particular, that the provision of that information does not represent an excessive administrative burden for operators in general or for smallholder farmers, producer organisations and cooperatives in particular.\nthe obligations laid down in this paragraph shall apply whether the biofuels or bioliquids are produced within the community or imported.\nmember states shall submit to the commission, in aggregated form, the information referred to in the first subparagraph of this paragraph. the commission shall publish that information on the transparency platform referred to in article\u00a024 in summary form preserving the confidentiality of commercially sensitive information.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the community shall endeavour to conclude bilateral or multilateral agreements with third countries containing provisions on sustainability criteria that correspond to those of this directive. where the community has concluded agreements containing provisions relating to matters covered by the sustainability criteria set out in article\u00a017(2) to\u00a0(5), the commission may decide that those agreements demonstrate that biofuels and bioliquids produced from raw materials cultivated in those countries comply with the sustainability criteria in question. when those agreements are concluded, due consideration shall be given to measures taken for the conservation of areas that provide, in critical situations, basic ecosystem services (such as watershed protection and erosion control), for soil, water and air protection, indirect land-use changes, the restoration of degraded land, the avoidance of excessive water consumption in areas where water is scarce and to the issues referred to in the second subparagraph of article\u00a017(7).\nthe commission may decide that voluntary national or international schemes setting standards for the production of biomass products contain accurate data for the purposes of article\u00a017(2) or demonstrate that consignments of biofuel comply with the sustainability criteria set out in article\u00a017(3) to\u00a0(5). the commission may decide that those schemes contain accurate data for the purposes of information on measures taken for the conservation of areas that provide, in critical situations, basic ecosystem services (such as watershed protection and erosion control), for soil, water and air protection, the restoration of degraded land, the avoidance of excessive water consumption in areas where water is scarce and on the issues referred to in the second subparagraph of article\u00a017(7). the commission may also recognise areas for the protection of rare, threatened or endangered ecosystems or species recognised by international agreements or included in lists drawn up by intergovernmental organisations or the international union for the conservation of nature for the purposes of article\u00a017(3)(b)(ii).\nthe commission may decide that voluntary national or international schemes to measure greenhouse gas emission saving contain accurate data for the purposes of article\u00a017(2).\nthe commission may decide that land that falls within the scope of a national or regional recovery programme aimed at improving severely degraded or heavily contaminated land fulfils the criteria referred to in point\u00a09 of part c of annex\u00a0v.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the commission shall adopt decisions under paragraph\u00a04 only if the agreement or scheme in question meets adequate standards of reliability, transparency and independent auditing. in the case of schemes to measure greenhouse gas emission saving, such schemes shall also comply with the methodological requirements in annex\u00a0v. lists of areas of high biodiversity value as referred to in article\u00a017(3)(b)(ii) shall meet adequate standards of objectivity and coherence with internationally recognised standards and provide for appropriate appeal procedures.\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0decisions under paragraph\u00a04 shall be adopted in accordance with the advisory procedure referred to in article\u00a025(3). such decisions shall be valid for a period of no more than five years.\n7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0when an economic operator provides proof or data obtained in accordance with an agreement or scheme that has been the subject of a decision pursuant to paragraph\u00a04, to the extent covered by that decision, a member state shall not require the supplier to provide further evidence of compliance with the sustainability criteria set out in article\u00a017(2) to\u00a0(5) nor information on measures referred to in the second subparagraph of paragraph\u00a03 of this article.\n8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0at the request of a member state or on its own initiative the commission shall examine the application of article\u00a017 in relation to a source of biofuel or bioliquid and, within six months of receipt of a request and in accordance with the advisory procedure referred to in article\u00a025(3), decide whether the member state concerned may take biofuel or bioliquid from that source into account for the purposes referred to in points\u00a0(a), (b) and\u00a0(c) of article\u00a017(1).\n9.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0by 31\u00a0december 2012, the commission shall report to the european parliament and to the council on:\n(a)\nthe effectiveness of the system in place for the provision of information on sustainability criteria; and\n(b)\nwhether it is feasible and appropriate to introduce mandatory requirements in relation to air, soil or water protection, taking into account the latest scientific evidence and the community\u2019s international obligations.\nthe commission

the permit-granting process\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0member\u00a0states shall set up or designate one or more contact points.\u00a0those contact points shall, upon request by the applicant, guide through and facilitate the entire administrative permit application and granting process.\u00a0the applicant shall not be required to contact more than one contact point for the entire process.\u00a0the permit-granting process shall cover the relevant administrative permits to build, repower and operate plants for the production of energy from renewable sources and assets necessary for their connection to the grid. the permit-granting process shall comprise all procedures from the acknowledgment of the receipt of the application to the transmission of the outcome of the procedure referred to in paragraph\u00a02.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the contact point shall guide the applicant through the administrative permit application process in a transparent manner up to the delivery of one or several decisions by the responsible authorities at the end of the process, provide the applicant with all necessary information and involve, where appropriate, other administrative authorities.\u00a0applicants shall be allowed to submit relevant documents also in digital form.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the contact point shall make available a manual of procedures for developers of renewable energy production projects and shall provide that information also online, addressing distinctly also small-scale projects and renewables self-consumers projects.\u00a0the online information shall indicate the contact point relevant to the applicant's application. if a member\u00a0state has more than one contact point, the online information shall indicate the contact point relevant to the applicant's application.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0without prejudice to paragraph\u00a07, the permit-granting process referred to in paragraph\u00a01 shall not exceed two years for power plants, including all relevant procedures of competent authorities.\u00a0where duly justified on the grounds of extraordinary circumstances, that two-year period may be extended by up to one year.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0without prejudice to paragraph\u00a07, the permit-granting process shall not exceed one year for installations with an electrical capacity of less than 150\u00a0kw. where duly justified on the grounds of extraordinary circumstances, that one-year period may be extended by up to one year.\nmember\u00a0states shall ensure that applicants have easy access to simple procedures for the settlement of disputes concerning the permit-granting process and the issuance of permits to build and operate renewable energy plants, including, where applicable, alternative dispute resolution mechanisms.\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0member\u00a0states shall facilitate the repowering of existing renewable energy plants by ensuring a simplified and swift permit-granting process.\u00a0the length of that process shall not exceed one\u00a0year.\nwhere duly justified on the grounds of extraordinary circumstances, such as on grounds of overriding safety reasons where the repowering project impacts substantially on the grid or the original capacity, size or performance of the installation, that one-year period may be extended by up to one year.\n7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the deadlines established in this article shall apply without prejudice to obligations under applicable union environmental law, to judicial appeals, remedies and other proceedings before a court or tribunal, and to alternative dispute resolution mechanisms, including complaints procedures, non-judicial appeals and remedies, and may be extended for the duration of such procedures.\n8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0member\u00a0states may establish a simple-notification procedure for grid connections for repowering projects as referred to in article\u00a017(1). where member\u00a0states do so, repowering shall be permitted following notification to the relevant authority where no significant negative environmental or social impact is expected. that authority shall decide within six months of receipt of a notification whether this is sufficient.\nwhere the relevant authority decides that a notification is sufficient, it shall automatically grant the permit.
