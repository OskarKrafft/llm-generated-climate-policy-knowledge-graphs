Each member state shall adopt a national renewable energy action plan. The national renewable energy action plans shall set out member states\u2019 national targets for the share of energy from renewable sources consumed in transport, electricity and heating and cooling in 2020, taking into account the effects of other policy measures relating to energy efficiency on final consumption of energy, and adequate measures to be taken to achieve those national overall targets, including cooperation between local, regional and national authorities, planned statistical transfers or joint projects, national policies to develop existing biomass resources and mobilise new biomass resources for different uses, and the measures to be taken to fulfil the requirements of articles 13 to 19. By 30 June 2009, the commission shall adopt a template for the national renewable energy action plans. That template shall comprise the minimum requirements set out in annex VI. Member states shall comply with that template in the presentation of their national renewable energy action plans.\n2. Member states shall notify their national renewable energy action plans to the commission by 30 June 2010.\n3. Each member state shall publish and notify to the commission, six months before its national renewable energy action plan is due, a forecast document indicating: (a) its estimated excess production of energy from renewable sources compared to the indicative trajectory which could be transferred to other member states in accordance with articles 6 to 11, as well as its estimated potential for joint projects, until 2020; and (b) its estimated demand for energy from renewable sources to be satisfied by means other than domestic production until 2020. That information may include elements relating to cost and benefits and financing. That forecast shall be updated in the reports of the member states as set out in article 22(1)(l) and (m).\n4. A member state whose share of energy from renewable sources fell below the indicative trajectory in the immediately preceding two-year period set out in part b of annex i, shall submit an amended national renewable energy action plan to the commission by 30 June of the following year, setting out adequate and proportionate measures to rejoin, within a reasonable timetable, the indicative trajectory in part b of annex i. The commission may, if the member state has not met the indicative trajectory by a limited margin, and taking due account of the current and future measures taken by the member state, adopt a decision to release the member state from the obligation to submit an amended national renewable energy action plan.\n5.

Each provision and criterion is clearly defined and linked to the overarching article (`polianna:Article1`). This makes it easier for users or systems to parse and understand the legislative requirements. \n\nNote that some text overlaps between provisions due to their similar nature, which can be refined further if necessary. Also, ensure all prefixes and namespaces are properly set up according to your specific use case. The `polianna:` namespace is a placeholder; you should replace it with an appropriate URI for your context.",

The contact point shall guide the applicant through the administrative permit application process in a transparent manner up to the delivery of one or several decisions by the responsible authorities at the end of the process, provide the applicant with all necessary information and involve, where appropriate, other administrative authorities. Applicants shall be allowed to submit relevant documents also in digital form.\n3.

Where duly justified on the grounds of extraordinary circumstances, that two-year period may be extended by up to one year.\n5. Without prejudice to paragraph 7, the permit-granting process shall not exceed one year for installations with an electrical capacity of less than 150 kW.

Member states shall facilitate the repowering of existing renewable energy plants by ensuring a simplified and swift permit-granting process. The length of that process shall not exceed one year.\nWhere duly justified on the grounds of extraordinary circumstances, such as on grounds of overriding safety reasons where the repowering project impacts substantially on the grid or the original capacity, size or performance of the installation, that one-year period may be extended by up to one year.\n7. The deadlines established in this article shall apply without prejudice to obligations under applicable union environmental law, to judicial appeals, remedies and other proceedings before a court or tribunal, and to alternative dispute resolution mechanisms, including complaints procedures, non-judicial appeals and remedies, and may be extended for the duration of such procedures.\n8. Member states may establish a simple-notification procedure for grid connections for repowering projects as referred to in article 17(1). Where member states do so, repowering shall be permitted following notification to the relevant authority where no significant negative environmental or social impact is expected. That authority shall decide within six months of receipt of a notification whether this is sufficient.\nWhere the relevant authority decides that a notification is sufficient, it shall automatically grant the permit. Where that authority decides that the notification is not sufficient, it shall be necessary to apply for a new permit and the time-limits referred to in paragraph 6 shall apply.\"\"\"\n] .\n```",

It seems like you are trying to outline requirements or actions related to some kind of regulatory document, possibly from the European Union. However, your representation is repetitive and somewhat unclear.\n\nLet's break down a more coherent approach:\n\n### Requirements and Actions\n\n1. **Ensure Compliance with Article 4:**\n   - Ensure that any updates to the plan are in line with the requirements specified in Article 4.\n   \n2. **Mitigate Adverse Impacts:**\n   - Identify potential adverse impacts of the updated plan on the environment and society, and implement measures to mitigate these effects.\n\n3. **Consider Environmental and Societal Impacts:**\n   - Evaluate how the proposed updates will affect both environmental and societal factors.\n\n4. **Follow Procedures Outlined in Article 4:**\n   - Adhere to all procedures detailed in Article 4 when updating the plan.\n\n### Example RDF (Resource Description Framework) Representation",
