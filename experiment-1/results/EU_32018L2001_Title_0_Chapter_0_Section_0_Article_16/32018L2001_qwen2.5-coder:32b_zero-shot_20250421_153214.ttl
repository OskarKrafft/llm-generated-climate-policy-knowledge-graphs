It seems like there is a repetition in the text. Could you please provide me with a cleaned-up version?
Certainly! It looks like the text has been repeated multiple times. Here's a cleaned-up version:

---

Below is the cleaned-up version of the text:

**Article 16:**

- **Paragraph 5:** Member states shall ensure that the provisions of this Directive are applied in such a way as to avoid unjustified discrimination on grounds of nationality.
  
- **Paragraph 7:** Without prejudice to paragraph 5, the permit-granting process shall not exceed one year for installations with an electrical capacity of less than 150 kW. Where duly justified on the grounds of extraordinary circumstances, that one-year period may be extended by up to one year.
