exemplary role of public bodies’ buildings
1.   without prejudice to article 7 of directive 2010/31/eu, each member state shall ensure that, as from 1 january 2014, 3 % of the total floor area of heated and/or cooled buildings owned and occupied by its central government is renovated each year to meet at least the minimum energy performance requirements that it has set in application of article 4 of directive 2010/31/eu.
the 3 % rate shall be calculated on the total floor area of buildings with a total useful floor area over 500 m2 owned and occupied by the central government of the member state concerned that, on 1 january of each year, do not meet the national minimum energy performance requirements set in application of article 4 of directive 2010/31/eu. that threshold shall be lowered to 250 m2 as of 9 july 2015.
where a member state requires that the obligation to renovate each year 3 % of the total floor area extends to floor area owned and occupied by administrative departments at a level below central government, the 3 % rate shall be calculated on the total floor area of buildings with a total useful floor area over 500 m2 and, as of 9 july 2015, over 250 m2 owned and occupied by central government and by these administrative departments of the member state concerned that, on 1 january of each year, do not meet the national minimum energy performance requirements set in application of article 4 of directive 2010/31/eu.
when implementing measures for the comprehensive renovation of central government buildings in accordance with the first subparagraph, member states may choose to consider the building as a whole, including the building envelope, equipment, operation and maintenance.
member states shall require that central government buildings with the poorest energy performance be a priority for energy efficiency measures, where cost-effective and technically feasible.
2.   member states may decide not to set or apply the requirements referred to in paragraph 1 to the following categories of buildings:
(a)
buildings officially protected as part of a designated environment, or because of their special architectural or historical merit, in so far as compliance with certain minimum energy performance requirements would unacceptably alter their character or appearance;
(b)
buildings owned by the armed forces or central government and serving national defence purposes, apart from single living quarters or office buildings for the armed forces and other staff employed by national defence authorities;
(c)
buildings used as places of worship and for religious activities.
3.   if a member state renovates more than 3 % of the total floor area of central government buildings in a given year, it may count the excess towards the annual renovation rate of any of the three previous or following years.
4.   member states may count towards the annual renovation rate of central government buildings new buildings occupied and owned as replacements for specific central government buildings demolished in any of the two previous years, or buildings that have been sold, demolished or taken out of use in any of the two previous years due to more intensive use of other buildings.
5.   for the purposes of paragraph 1, by 31 december 2013, member states shall establish and make publicly available an inventory of heated and/or cooled central government buildings with a total useful floor area over 500 m2 and, as of 9 july 2015, over 250 m2, excluding buildings exempted on the basis of paragraph 2. the inventory shall contain the following data:
(a)
the floor area in m2; and
(b)
the energy performance of each building or relevant energy data.
6.   without prejudice to article 7 of directive 2010/31/eu, member states may opt for an alternative approach to paragraphs 1 to 5 of this article, whereby they take other cost-effective measures, including deep renovations and measures for behavioural change of occupants, to achieve, by 2020, an amount of energy savings in eligible buildings owned and occupied by their central government that is at least equivalent to that required in paragraph 1, reported on an annual basis.
for the purpose of the alternative approach, member states may estimate the energy savings that paragraphs 1 to 4 would generate by using appropriate standard values for the energy consumption of reference central government buildings before and after renovation and according to estimates of the surface of their stock. the categories of reference central government buildings shall be representative of the stock of such buildings.
member states opting for the alternative approach shall notify to the commission, by 31 december 2013, the alternative measures that they plan to adopt, showing how they would achieve an equivalent improvement in the energy performance of the buildings within the central government estate.
7.   member states shall encourage public bodies, including at regional and local level, and social housing bodies governed by public law, with due regard for their respective competences and administrative set-up, to:
(a)
adopt an energy efficiency plan, freestanding or as part of a broader climate or environmental plan, containing specific energy saving and efficiency objectives and actions, with a view to following the exemplary role of central government buildings laid down in paragraphs 1, 5 and 6;
(b)
put in place an energy management system, including energy audits, as part of the implementation of their plan;
(c)
use, where appropriate, energy service companies, and energy performance contracting to finance renovations and implement plans to maintain or improve energy efficiency in the long term.
