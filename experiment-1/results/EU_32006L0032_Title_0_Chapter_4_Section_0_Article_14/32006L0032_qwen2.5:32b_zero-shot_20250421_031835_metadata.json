Such submissions shall take place as soon as possible, preferably not later than 17 November 2006. This information will enable the commission to take due account of existing practices.\n    2.

Not later than 17 May 2008, the commission shall publish a cost/benefit impact assessment examining the linkages between EU standards, regulations, policies and measures on end-use energy efficiency.\n    4. The EEAPs shall be assessed in accordance with the procedure referred to in article 16(2):\n    \u2014 the first EEAPs shall be reviewed before 1 January 2008;\n    \u2014 the second EEAPs shall be reviewed before 1 January 2012;\n    \u2014 the third EEAPs shall be reviewed before 1 January 2015.\n    5.

The reports shall take into account the benchmarking system referred to in article 15(4), identify best practices, identify cases where member states and/or the commission are not making enough progress, and may contain recommendations.\n    The second report shall be followed, as appropriate and where necessary, by proposals to the European Parliament and to the Council for additional measures including a possible extension of the period of application of targets.
