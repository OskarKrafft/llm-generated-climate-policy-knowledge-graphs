As part of that review, the Commission shall examine in what manner Member States could apply integrated district or neighbourhood approaches in Union building and energy efficiency policy, while ensuring that each building meets the minimum energy performance requirements, for example by means of overall renovation schemes applying to a number of buildings in a spatial context instead of a single building."@en ;
