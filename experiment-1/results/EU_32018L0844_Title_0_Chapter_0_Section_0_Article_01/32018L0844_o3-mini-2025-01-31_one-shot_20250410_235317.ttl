system requirements shall be set for new, replacement and upgrading of technical building systems and shall be applied in so far as they are technically, economically and functionally feasible.
member states shall require new buildings, where technically and economically feasible, to be equipped with self-regulating devices for the separate regulation of the temperature in each room or, where justified, in a designated heated zone of the building unit. in existing buildings, the installation of such self-regulating devices shall be required when heat generators are replaced, where technically and economically feasible.
2.   with regard to new non-residential buildings and non-residential buildings undergoing major renovation, with more than ten parking spaces, member states shall ensure the installation of at least one recharging point within the meaning of directive 2014/94/eu of the european parliament and of the council (*3) and ducting infrastructure, namely conduits for electric cables, for at least one in every five parking spaces to enable the installation at a later stage of recharging points for electric vehicles where:
(a)
the car park is located inside the building, and, for major renovations, renovation measures include the car park or the electrical infrastructure of the building; or
(b)
the car park is physically adjacent to the building, and, for major renovations, renovation measures include the car park or the electrical infrastructure of the car park.
