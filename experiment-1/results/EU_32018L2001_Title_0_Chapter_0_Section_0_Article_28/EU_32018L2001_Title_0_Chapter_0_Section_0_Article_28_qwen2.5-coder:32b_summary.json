It appears that the text provided was repetitive and not reflective of the actual content of Article 4 of an EU directive. Without knowing the specific directive, I'll provide a general idea of what Article 4 might cover based on common themes in EU directives.\n\nArticle 4 in many EU directives often deals with definitions or key terms used throughout the document. It specifies the meanings of technical terms to ensure consistency and clarity across different parts of the directive and among member states when implementing it.\n\nIf you can provide more details about which specific EU directive you are referring to, I could give a more accurate summary of Article 4 for that particular piece of legislation.",

It appears that the text provided was repetitive and not reflective of the actual content of Article 4 of an EU directive. Without knowing the specific directive, I'll provide a general idea of what Article 4 might cover based on common themes in EU directives.\n\nArticle 4 in many EU directives often deals with definitions or key terms used throughout the document. It specifies the meanings of technical terms to ensure consistency and clarity across different parts of the directive and among member states when implementing it.\n\nIf you can provide more details about which specific EU directive you are referring to, I could give a more accurate summary of Article 4 for that particular piece of legislation.",

It appears that the text provided was repetitive and not reflective of the actual content of Article 4 of an EU directive. Without knowing the specific directive, I'll provide a general idea of what Article 4 might cover based on common themes in EU directives.\n\nArticle 4 in many EU directives often deals with definitions or key terms used throughout the document. It specifies the meanings of technical terms to ensure consistency and clarity across different parts of the directive and among member states when implementing it.\n\nIf you can provide more details about which specific EU directive you are referring to, I could give a more accurate summary of Article 4 for that particular piece of legislation.",
