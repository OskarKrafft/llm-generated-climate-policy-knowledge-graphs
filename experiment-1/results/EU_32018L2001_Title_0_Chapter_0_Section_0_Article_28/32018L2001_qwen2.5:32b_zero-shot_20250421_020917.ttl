    pol:hasContent "By 25 June 2019 and every two years thereafter, the Commission shall review the list of feedstock set out in Parts A and B of Annex IX with a view to adding feedstock in accordance with the principles set out in the third subparagraph. The Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 35 to amend the list of feedstock set out in Parts A and B of Annex IX by adding, but not removing, feedstock.",
        "By 31 December 2021, member states shall take measures to ensure the availability of fuels from renewable sources for transport including with regard to publicly accessible high-power recharging points and other refuelling infrastructure as provided for in their national policy frameworks in accordance with Directive 2014/94/EU.",
        "By 31 December 2021, the Commission shall adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 35 to supplement this Directive by specifying the methodology to determine the share of biofuel and biogas for transport resulting from biomass being processed with fossil fuels in a common process, and by specifying the methodology for assessing greenhouse gas emissions savings from renewable liquid and gaseous transport fuels of non-biological origin and from recycled carbon fuels, which shall ensure that credit for avoided emissions is not given for CO2 the capture of which has already received an emission credit under other provisions of law.",
        "By 31 December 2025, in the context of the biennial assessment of progress made pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2018/1999, the Commission shall assess whether the obligation relating to advanced biofuels and biogas produced from feedstock listed in Part A of Annex IX laid down in the fourth subparagraph of Article 25(1) effectively stimulates innovation and ensures greenhouse gas emissions savings in the transport sector. The Commission shall analyse in that assessment whether the application of this article effectively avoids double accounting of renewable energy. The Commission shall, if appropriate, submit a proposal to amend the obligation relating to advanced biofuels and biogas produced from feedstock listed in Part A of Annex IX laid down in the fourth subparagraph of Article 25(1).",
