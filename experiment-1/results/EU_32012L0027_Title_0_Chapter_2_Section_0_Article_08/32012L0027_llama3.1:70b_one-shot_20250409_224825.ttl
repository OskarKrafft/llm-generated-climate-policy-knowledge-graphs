    Member States shall promote the availability to all final customers of high quality energy audits which are cost-effective and:

    (b) implemented and supervised by independent authorities under national legislation.
    The energy audits referred to in the first subparagraph may be carried out by in-house experts or energy auditors provided that the Member State concerned has put in place a scheme to assure and check their quality, including, if appropriate, an annual random selection of at least a statistically significant percentage of all the energy audits they carry out.
