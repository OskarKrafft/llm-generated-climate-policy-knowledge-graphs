    1. On the basis of the harmonised efficiency reference values referred to in point (f) of Annex II, Member States shall ensure that the origin of electricity produced from high-efficiency cogeneration can be guaranteed according to objective, transparent and non-discriminatory criteria laid down by each Member State.

    2. They shall ensure that this guarantee of origin complies with the requirements and contains at least the information specified in Annex X.

    3. Member States shall mutually recognise their guarantees of origin, exclusively as proof of the information referred to in this paragraph.

    5. Member States shall notify the Commission of such refusal and its justification.

    6. In the event of refusal to recognise a guarantee of origin, the Commission may adopt a decision to compel the refusing party to recognise it, in particular with regard to objective, transparent and non-discriminatory criteria on which such recognition is based.
