referred to under the heading \u2018environment\u2019 in part a and in point\u00a09 of annex\u00a0ii to council regulation (ec) no\u00a073/2009 of 19\u00a0january 2009 establishing common rules for direct support schemes for farmers under the common agricultural policy and establishing certain support schemes for farmers (22) and in accordance with the minimum requirements for good agricultural and environmental condition defined pursuant to article\u00a06(1) of that regulation.\n7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the commission shall, every two years, report to the european parliament and the council, in respect of both third countries and member states that are a significant source of biofuels or of raw material for biofuels consumed within the community, on national measures taken to respect the sustainability criteria set out in paragraphs\u00a02 to\u00a05 and for soil, water and air protection. the first report shall be submitted in 2012.\nthe commission shall, every two years, report to the european parliament and the council on the impact on social sustainability in the community and in third countries of increased demand for biofuel, on the impact of community biofuel policy on the availability of foodstuffs at affordable prices, in particular for people living in developing countries, and wider development issues. reports shall address the respect of land-use rights. they shall state, both for third countries and member states that are a significant source of raw material for biofuel consumed within the community, whether the country has ratified and implemented each of the following conventions of the international labour organisation:\n\u2014 convention concerning forced or compulsory labour (no\u00a029),\n\u2014 convention concerning freedom of association and protection of the right to organise (no\u00a087),\n\u2014 convention concerning the application of the principles of the right to organise and to bargain collectively (no\u00a098),\n\u2014 convention concerning equal remuneration of men and women workers for work of equal value (no\u00a0100),\n\u2014 convention concerning the abolition of forced labour (no\u00a0105),\n\u2014 convention concerning discrimination in respect of employment and occupation (no\u00a0111),\n\u2014 convention concerning minimum age for admission to employment (no\u00a0138),\n\u2014 convention concerning the prohibition and immediate action for the elimination of the worst forms of child labour (no\u00a0182).\nthose reports shall state, both for third countries and member states that are a significant source of raw material for biofuel consumed within the community, whether the country has ratified and implemented:\n\u2014 the cartagena protocol on biosafety,\n\u2014 the convention on international trade in endangered species of wild fauna and flora.\nthe first report shall be submitted in 2012. the commission shall, if appropriate, propose corrective action, in particular if evidence shows that biofuel production has a significant impact on food prices.\n8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0for the purposes referred to in points\u00a0(a), (b) and\u00a0(c) of paragraph\u00a01, member states shall not refuse to take into account, on other sustainability grounds, biofuels and bioliquids obtained in compliance with this article.\n9.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the commission shall report on requirements for a sustainability scheme for energy uses of biomass, other than biofuels and bioliquids, by 31\u00a0december 2009. that report shall be accompanied, where appropriate, by proposals for a sustainability scheme for other energy uses of biomass, to the european parliament and the council. that report and any proposals contained therein shall be based on the best available scientific evidence, taking into account new developments in innovative processes. if the analysis done for that purpose demonstrates that it would be appropriate to introduce amendments, in relation to forest biomass, in the calculation methodology in annex\u00a0v or in the sustainability criteria relating to carbon stocks applied to biofuels and bioliquids, the commission shall, where appropriate, make proposals to the european parliament and council at the same time in this regard.\" .\n```",
