incentives that lead to the application of energy\u2010efficient technology or techniques and have the effect of reducing end\u2010use energy consumption;\n(c)\nregulations or voluntary agreements that lead to the application of energy\u2010efficient technology or techniques and have the effect of reducing end\u2010use energy consumption;\n(d)\nstandards and norms that aim at improving the energy efficiency of products and services, including buildings and vehicles, except where these are mandatory and applicable in member states under union law;\n(e)\nenergy labelling schemes, with the exception of those that are mandatory and applicable in the member states under union law;\n(f)\ntraining and education, including energy advisory programmes, that lead to the application of energy\u2010efficient technology or techniques and have the effect of reducing end\u2010use energy consumption.\nmember states shall notify to the commission, by 5 december 2013, the policy measures that they plan to adopt for the purposes of the first subparagraph and article 20(6), following the framework provided in point 4 of annex v, and showing how they would achieve the required amount of savings. in the case of the policy measures referred to in the second subparagraph and in article 20(6), this notification shall demonstrate how the criteria in paragraph 10 are met. in the case of policy measures other than those referred to in the second subparagraph or in article 20(6), member states shall explain how an equivalent level of savings, monitoring and verification is achieved. the commission may make suggestions for modifications in the three months following notification.\n10.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0without prejudice to paragraph 11, the criteria for the policy measures taken pursuant to the second subparagraph of paragraph 9 and article 20(6) shall be as follows:\n(a)\nthe policy measures provide for at least two intermediate periods by 31 december 2020 and lead to the achievement of the level of ambition set out in paragraph 1;\n(b)\nthe responsibility of each entrusted party, participating party or implementing public authority, whichever is relevant, is defined;\n(c)\nthe energy savings that are to be achieved are determined in a transparent manner;\n(d)\nthe amount of energy savings required or to be achieved by the policy measure are expressed in either final or primary energy consumption, using the conversion factors set out in annex iv;\n(e)\nenergy savings are calculated using the methods and principles provided in points (1) and (2) of annex v;\n(f)\nenergy savings are calculated using the methods and principles provided in point 3 of annex v;\n(g)\nan annual report of the energy savings achieved is provided by participating parties unless not feasible and made publicly available;\n(h)\nmonitoring of the results is ensured and appropriate measures are envisaged if the progress is not satisfactory;\n(i)\na control system is put in place that also includes independent verification of a statistically significant proportion of the energy efficiency improvement measures;\n(j)\ndata on the annual trend of energy savings are published annually.\n11.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0member states shall ensure that the taxes referred to in point (a) of the second subparagraph of paragraph 9 comply with the criteria listed in points (a), (b), (c), (d), (f), (h) and (j) of paragraph 10.\nmember states shall ensure that the regulations and voluntary agreements referred to in point (c) of the second subparagraph of paragraph 9 comply
