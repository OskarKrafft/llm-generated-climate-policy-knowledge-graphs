Each provision and criterion is clearly defined and linked to the overarching article (`polianna:Article1`). This makes it easier for users or systems to parse and understand the legislative requirements. \n\nNote that some text overlaps between provisions due to their similar nature, which can be refined further if necessary. Also, ensure all prefixes and namespaces are properly set up according to your specific use case. The `polianna:` namespace is a placeholder; you should replace it with an appropriate URI for your context.",
