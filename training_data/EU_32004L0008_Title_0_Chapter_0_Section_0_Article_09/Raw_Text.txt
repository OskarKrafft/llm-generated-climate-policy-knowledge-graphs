article 9
administrative procedures
1. member states or the competent bodies appointed by the member states shall evaluate the existing legislative and regulatory framework with regard to authorisation procedures or the other procedures laid down in article 6 of directive 2003/54/ec, which are applicable to high-efficiency cogeneration units.
such evaluation shall be made with a view to:
(a) encouraging the design of cogeneration units to match economically justifiable demands for useful heat output and avoiding production of more heat than useful heat;
(b) reducing the regulatory and non-regulatory barriers to an increase in cogeneration;
(c) streamlining and expediting procedures at the appropriate administrative level; and
(d) ensuring that the rules are objective, transparent and non-discriminatory, and take fully into account the particularities of the various cogeneration technologies.
2. member states shall - where this is appropriate in the context of national legislation - provide an indication of the stage reached specifically in:
(a) coordination between the different administrative bodies as regards deadlines, reception and treatment of applications for authorisations;
(b) the drawing up of possible guidelines for the activities referred to in paragraph 1, and the feasibility of a fast-track planning procedure for cogeneration producers; and
(c) the designation of authorities to act as mediators in disputes between authorities responsible for issuing authorisations and applicants for authorisations.
