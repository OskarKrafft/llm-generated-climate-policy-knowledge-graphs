right to out-of-court dispute settlement
1.   member states shall ensure that final customers have access to simple, fair, transparent, independent, effective and efficient out-of-court mechanisms for the settlement of disputes concerning rights and obligations established under this directive, through an independent mechanism such as an energy ombudsman or a consumer body, or through a regulatory authority. where the final customer is a consumer within the meaning of directive 2013/11/eu of the european parliament and of the council (23), such out-of-court dispute settlement mechanisms shall comply with the quality requirements of directive 2013/11/eu and shall provide, where warranted, for systems of reimbursement and compensation.
2.   where necessary, member states shall ensure that alternative dispute resolution entities cooperate to provide simple, fair, transparent, independent, effective and efficient out-of-court dispute settlement mechanisms for any dispute that arises from products or services that are tied to, or bundled with, any product or service falling under the scope of this directive.
3.   the participation of electricity undertakings in out-of-court dispute settlement mechanisms for household customers shall be mandatory unless the member state demonstrates to the commission that other mechanisms are equally effective.
