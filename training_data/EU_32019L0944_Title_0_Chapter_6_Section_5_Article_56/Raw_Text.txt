1.   member states shall take the necessary steps to ensure that the accounts of electricity undertakings are kept in accordance with paragraphs 2 and 3.
2.   electricity undertakings, whatever their system of ownership or legal form, shall draw up, submit to audit and publish their annual accounts in accordance with the rules of national law concerning the annual accounts of limited liability companies adopted pursuant to directive 2013/34/eu.
undertakings which are not legally obliged to publish their annual accounts shall keep a copy of these at the disposal of the public in their head office.
3.   electricity undertakings shall, in their internal accounting, keep separate accounts for each of their transmission and distribution activities as they would be required to do if the activities in question were carried out by separate undertakings, with a view to avoiding discrimination, cross-subsidisation and distortion of competition. they shall also keep accounts, which may be consolidated, for other electricity activities not relating to transmission or distribution. revenue from ownership of the transmission or distribution system shall be specified in the accounts. where appropriate, they shall keep consolidated accounts for other, non-electricity activities. the internal accounts shall include a balance sheet and a profit and loss account for each activity.
4.   the audit referred to in paragraph 2 shall, in particular, verify that the obligation to avoid discrimination and cross-subsidisation referred to in paragraph 3 is respected.
