article 7
support schemes
1. member states shall ensure that support for cogeneration - existing and future units - is based on the useful heat demand and primary energy savings, in the light of opportunities available for reducing energy demand through other economically feasible or environmental advantageous measures like other energy efficiency measures.
2. without prejudice to articles 87 and 88 of the treaty, the commission shall evaluate the application of support mechanisms used in member states according to which a producer of cogeneration receives, on the basis of regulations issued by public authorities, direct or indirect support, which could have the effect of restricting trade.
the commission shall consider whether those mechanisms contribute to the pursuit of the objectives set out in articles 6 and 174(1) of the treaty.
3. the commission shall in the report referred to in article 11 present a well-documented analysis on experience gained with the application and coexistence of the different support mechanisms referred to in paragraph 2 of this article. the report shall assess the success, including cost-effectiveness, of the support systems in promoting the use of high-efficiency cogeneration in conformity with the national potentials referred to in article 6. the report shall further review to what extent the support schemes have contributed to the creation of stable conditions for investments in cogeneration.
