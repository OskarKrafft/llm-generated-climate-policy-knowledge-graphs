(b)
set up a distribution rule agreed by participating member states that allocates amounts of energy from renewable sources between the participating member states. such a rule shall be notified to the commission no later than three months after the end of the first year in which it takes effect.
2.   within three months of the end of each year each member state having made a notification under paragraph 1(b) shall issue a letter of notification stating the total amount of electricity or heating or cooling from renewable energy sources produced during the year which is to be the subject of the distribution rule.
3.   for the purposes of measuring compliance with the requirements of this directive concerning national overall targets, the amount of electricity or heating or cooling from renewable energy sources notified in accordance with paragraph 2 shall be reallocated between the concerned member states in accordance with the notified distribution rule.
